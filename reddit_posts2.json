                "Well, while war is always hell and chaotic destruction, I got to say that I firmly back the stiff posture of the Ukraine here.   \n\nLet no one forget that it was Russia who illegally crossed the border with troops and took over possessing land that belonged to Ukraine, a sovereign Nation... a sovereign Democratic Nation at that.   \n\nHistory tries to repeat itself... so I draw eerie similarities with President Trump's.peave agreement overtures which basically stating and Pres. Trump trying to bully Ukraine into accepting some land lost...namely the lands Russia already has invaded and took control of.for the time being in the Donesk region.  That sounds eerily similar to the prime Minister who came before Winston Churchill, who came back with the \"Peace in our Time\" trendy slogan where the European nations basically signed over nearly all of Czechoslovakia and other areas taken control of by Hitler just prior to WW2 with the promise by Hitler that he wouldn't continue on his land grabs.  Turns out in history that Hitler didn't abide by his promise and he turned right around and just kept land grabbing by invasion.\n\n I see no reason why Putin wouldn't do the same thing other than the fact that Russia is getting their ass fucking handed to them by the Ukraine vis-a-vis donated NATO weapons.  While Ukraine forces are good, they were originally outmanned 64 to 1. \n\n Without the advanced weapon systems given to Ukraine by NATO, Russia would have boss hog smashed the Ukraine.  I am sure that pisses Putin off where he had dreams of the grand legacy of rebuilding the Soviet Empire. Yet, I think it's crazy to allow Russia any benefits here where they illegally invaded a sovereign democratic-values nation without cause or provocation simply because Ukraine voted in a leader that was not friendly to Putin or Russia.  Giving in and giving up the land grabs he has thus far would only serve to encourage other nations to do the same.  Such as China for instance who salivates waiting for a time to invade Taiwan.\n\nLet's be frank.... the situation is that we are a democratic nation as Ukraine is.  We're supposed to support our kindred spirits as such because we would want the same.  Taiwan and South Korea and Philippines and Japan are all watching closely how the USA handles this as it would be seen as representative of how we would support them in similar circumstances.  China is mindful that they too might be able to negotiate similarly by force invasion of Taiwan.  See, it is not so simple.  \n\nAs for the UK, bravo on the pledgr for troops, but supporting anything less than a full withdrawal by Russia is a sin and counter to both our nations' promise of liberty and opportunity in democratic ideals.  We would be hypocrits to back anything less than full withdrawal by Russia.  It is not okay to simply invade whoever you want when you want to get what you want.  \n\nThe Ukraine is completely against the proposed peace agreement and I don't blame them.  I think they should stand strong and stand firm. Russia should withdraw their forces back to their own border.  Humble pie though will be a nasty treat to eat for Russia though, but serves them right."

                "The short answer is NATO weapons systems on Russia's border although they're claimed to be defensive, can be converted to be used offensively to drastically reduce Russia's ability for a second-strike response. Similarity can be drawn from the Cuban Missile Crisis. The longer answer is as follows.\n\nNATO was created strictly to counter the USSR. After the Soviet Union collapsed alongside the former Warsaw Pact, why did NATO not only continue to exist but grow in power to an unprecedented level? What did Russia do between 1991-2013 that was so egregious to European security interests?\n\nThe justification for NATO expansionism has been that Russia supposedly has aspirations for empire building.\nFor all the talk of Russian imperialism and that Putin wants to rebuild the Russian empire, all they've managed to do between 1991-2013 is quell an internal crisis in Chechnya and support separatists in Transnistria, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. That doesn't seem like serious empire building to me. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and starting supporting Donbass. More substantial actions, but not quite empire building. Now they've started a war in Ukraine, the most substantial move to date but not what I consider the beginning of building an empire, since they'll never be able to control the territory entirely.\n\nNATO needs Russia to be perceived as an enemy to validate it's existence. NATO needs Russia to be it's enemy, it's raison d'etre."

            "text": "Edit: it's \"message\", I've just mistyped lol\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not advocating anything in this post. I do not disseminate deliberately false information and do not betray my homeland. All I want is to speak up.  \n\nI am Russian, I am 21 y. o. and I am a student. When the problem with Ukraine started in 2013-2014, I was 13 y. o. I didn’t watch the news, as I wasn’t interested in it, and I didn’t understand anything about politics.  \n\nA lot has changed over the years, and so have I. When the war began on February 24, to be honest, I was not even surprised. This does not mean that I SUPPORT the war. On the contrary, I believe that every life is sacred. But I always knew that despite humanism and pacifism, wars have always been, are and will be. And we all have one end - death, merely someone will die earlier, and someone later. And this is a reality.  \n\nThe first thing I did was to read the news and follow the situation. But when I went to social networks, where I follow some Ukrainian bloggers, I felt absolutely uncomfortable. I faced the strongest psychological pressure when a person told me through the screen that it was ME who was to blame for what had happened, ant it is MY fault that I, like all Russians, was allegedly apolitical. Many Russians succumbed to this and began to apologize. But I don’t want to apologize. Because when I turned 18, I acquired the right to vote, which I have always used as intended. I am not apolitical, I am no longer 13 y. o. girl, and I did NOT make this decision.  \n\nDespite this unpleasant moment, I do not feel hatred for Ukrainians. I’m sorry this war happened. I know that civilians are dying, I know everything. I have no relatives in Ukraine, but I have friends and acquaintances for whom I worry. I even know a Ukrainian soldier who is now fighting against my country, but we do not hate each other.  \n\nYesterday I decided to look into the origins of the current situation and began to read about the Euromaidan. I am one of those people who is looking for cause and effect relationships. And I found the following:  \n\n- during the Euromaidan, which was originally a protest action of civilians for Ukraine to join the European Union, diverse nationalist groups (UNA-UNSO, “Trident”, “Patriot of Ukraine”, etc.) formed the right-wing extremist association “Right Sector”, considering the Euromaidan only as a convenient pretext for starting a “national revolution”, which, according to the leader of the “Right Sector” Dmytro Yarosh, was supposed to end with “the complete elimination of the regime of internal occupation and the creation of a Ukrainian national state with a system of all-encompassing national democracy”;  \n\n- Representatives of the parliamentary opposition said that the government intends to establish an authoritarian dictatorship in Ukraine, and demanded the convocation of the People’s Rada instead of the compromised Verkhovna Rada, the resignation of President Yanukovych and early presidential elections. In the following days, opposition-minded demonstrators in a number of regions of Ukraine proceeded to seize the buildings of regional state administrations. In western Ukraine, these actions were successful, while in the regions of central Ukraine, these attempts were suppressed by law enforcement agencies;  \n\n- On February 21, under pressure from Western countries, President Yanukovych made concessions and signed an agreement with the opposition to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, which included, in particular, an immediate return to the Constitution as amended in 2004, the formation of a government of national unity, holding early presidential elections no later than December 2014 year, non-use of violence and investigation of recent acts of violence. On the same day, Yanukovych left Kyiv;  \n\nI would like to note that very little is written in the foreign media about the role of radical right parties in this event.  \n\n- Right Sector’s political ideology has been described as hardline right-wing nationalist, neo-fascist, or neo-Nazi, and right-wing, far-right or radical right. Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in Russian media during the first half of 2014, and Russian state TV depicted it as neo-Nazi because of its far-right, extremist views and anti-Russian sentiment; the Associated Press found no evidence that the group had committed hate crimes. According to the UN Human Rights Council, Right Sector is one of “potentially violent militias that acted seemingly on their own authority, thanks to a high level of official tolerance, and with almost complete impunity, both in the Donbass region and in wider Ukraine” that “use violence or threats of violence to exert pressure on persons holding dissenting views, the judicial system and other mechanisms of accountability”.  \n\n- The other main far-right party Right Sector won 1 seat (of the 450 seats in the Ukrainian parliament) in the same 2014 election.  \n\nMy question is: how can a radical right party, which even the Foreign media consider as neo-fascist one, be tolerant of other nations, and how can one say that the Russian media exaggerates everything? Meanwhile, the same foreign media are writing the following:  \n\n- In the wake of the 2014 Euromaidan, Eduard Dolinsky, executive director of the Kyiv-based Ukrainian Jewish Committee, expressed concern over the rise of antisemitism in Ukraine in an opinion for the New York Times, citing the social acceptance of previously marginal far- right groups and the government’s policy of historical negationism with regard to antisemitic views of, and collaboration in the Holocaust by Ukrainian nationalists. Dolinsky also pointed out that Ukrainian Jews overwhelmingly supported and often participated in the Euromaidan protests.  \n\nHere are my favorite discoveries:  \n\n- American economist and political commentator Paul Roberts said that everything that happens in Ukraine was financed by the United States. He also noted: “This does not mean that the Ukrainians have no real justified claims. However, it is clear that all this is planned for Ukraine to join the EU and NATO in the future. Because the main goal of the United States is to locate its own military bases on its territory, next to the Russian border. On December 13, 2013, US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated during the Ukraine-USA Foundation conference that the United States has supported the building of democracy in Ukraine since its independence in 1991, and also called on the government, the president and the Ukrainian people to heed the voice of Euromaidan. The speech said that $5 billion had been spent on building democracy and other goals.  \n\n- US President Barack Obama on February 1, 2015, said in an interview with CNN that “we mediated the transition of power in Ukraine.”  \n\nThis is not propaganda. These are confirmed official facts that can be found on the Internet with all the necessary links.  \n\nWhile I was looking for information in every language available to me, I noticed the following: foreign media are actively putting Russia in a bad position. Both in English and in Ukrainian Wikipedia they write that it was Russia that sponsored the Anti-Maidan movement. Perhaps this is true, I do not know. Meanwhile, the Russian Wikipedia writes, as you have already noticed, that the radical right movements and the Euromaidan were funded by the USA.  \n\nBased on these mutual accusations, we can draw the following conclusion: the war is not between Russia and Ukraine, but between Russia and the USA (aka NATO). And, as Paul Roberts pointed out, the problem is that US-led NATO is trying to contain Russia by building military bases in neighboring countries. Then it turns out that Russia really does not benefit from Ukraine’s accession to the European Union, but also everyone knows that for the same reason Russia does not return the Kuril Islands to Japan.  \n\nBy encircling Russia, NATO will be able to rule my country. Perhaps we will be forced to sell oil, gas and other resources for next to nothing. They might force us to do something else. But if Russia will try to get out of this control, “our temple will already have the barrel of a gun next to it.”  \n\nI don’t know if our government made the right decision by starting this war. I don’t like either the war or the prospect of becoming dependent on NATO. But as it seemed to me, from the point of view of politics, the question has no long been between war and peace. The question that confronts us is like the trolley problem. And perhaps our government has to choose the lesser of two evils.  \n\nRegarding the attitude of the Russians:  \n\nThere are idiots everywhere, that’s a fact. From my observation, a lot of people in Russia are worried about the Ukrainians. The problem is that any attempts to express the opinion against the decision taken by the Russian government are suppressed. Yesterday I was walking along Nevsky Prospekt, and there was a huge number of police cars, ready to catch the protesters. Posts on the Internet are considered treason. Students at my university are being expelled for taking part in demonstrations. The media of all countries lie, and the Ukrainians in the comments psychologically put pressure on the Russians, asking to participate in demonstrations even at the cost of our own lives.  \n\nI am writing this post with fear that the government of my own country will consider me a traitor. But my desire to convey this information is too strong, because, being Russian, I am tired of hearing from everywhere year after year that Russians are a terrible nation. Please, stop blaming the Russians for everything, our opinion wasn’t asked when this decision was made.  \n\nMy grandfather was a child during World War II. His village was occupied by the Nazis. In front of his eyes, his older brother was blown up on a mine. My grandfather himself once stumbled upon a mine and his finger was torn off. He saw shelling, explosions and enemy planes. He was on the verge of life and death. But he never hated the Germans. Because German soldiers fed him and other Russian children with a food and German chocolate, which was hard to come by even in the 80s.  \n\nAs for myself, I do not hate Ukrainians, and I hope for the same in return. No war is a reason to hate each other. Hatred breeds another hatred, and once this cycle begins, it will never end.  \n\nI have a right to tell this because I know what it’s like to lose relatives. I saw my grandmother’s face when my uncle died. He was a military man, he was killed by other soldiers during the audit, because he did his job too responsibly. I saw my grandmother’s eyes, I saw her go crazy, I saw her give up. She died.  \n\nPlease don’t give up no matter what. Stay safe and don’t give in to the lowest feelings. If you give up, you lose. To lose means to die.",

                "The two things that the vast majority of Russians have yet to understand are:\n\n1) The Russian government has been lying and exaggerating the right-wing fascist role in Euromaidan and the subsequent Ukrainian government for 8 years. Originally, because that narrative justified in moral terms the annexation of Crimea and then the continuation of a frozen conflict in Donbas. Never were the majority of Ukrainians, the majority of Ukrainian voters, the majority of Ukrainian armed volunteers, the majority of Ukrainian politicians, the majority of the Ukrainian military right-wing fascists and/or nazis. Never did the Ukrainian right-wing hold enough power to greatly influence nationally policy and they certainly have failed to maintain any staying power. They were covered by the US media, and widely on the internet, in great part for the sensationalist aspect - Russian media domestically amplified the sensationalism to absolutely absurd heights because Russia's economy tanked and stagnated after 2014 and Ukrainian fascists provided a nice distraction from the extent to which Russia's economy stumbled as well as a rallying cry to unite at least enough Russians behind Putin.\n\n2) The United States did not, despite whatever Obama claims (let's remember Syria at this exact same moment in time was an absolute foreign policy debacle for him) and whatever Paul Robertson (a long retired Reagan-era functionary) claims. Victoria Nuland was a red herring (a metaphor for a distraction), as was all that the Russians \"uncovered\" that America was doing in Ukraine. The US was not committed to resolving the frozen conflict in the Donbas until suddenly it became a hot conflict two weeks ago. NATO was basically disintegrating because it had no purpose... until two weeks ago. Narratives about NATO as a unified entity, as a diabolical platform for the destruction of Russia, are just absolutely so absurd to people who study international security from around the rest of the world that Russia and it's foreign policy statements make it a laughing stock simply because all those claims are bullshit. Just like the absurdity of Russia's launch and catastrophic execution of this war so far only reinforces the idea abroad that Russia's strength is spent, that it is a state drowned in its own fantastical propaganda about its own glory and self righteousness. Putin's fumbling of this whole affair has proven that the Russian government, military, economic integrity, and national politics make it at best a second rate regional power that just so happens to have inherited nuclear weapons. Russia has no steadfast friends, no steadfast economic base, no steadfast moral compass and therefore will take years if not decades to even begin repairing its image save for a dramatic change in government (which the US will no orchestrate because the US most of all doesn't want thermonuclear war). NATO - and the vast majority of its members - had no interest in Russia up until about February 24, 2022, and the majority of states in it would have been just as happy without the alliance because NATO was a stumbling block to European economic integration rather than - as Russians claim - the diabolical end point of EU integration. Everything Russians \"know\" about NATO and world politics are solidly based on disinformation, targeted propaganda, and straight up Russian state media lies. Russians view NATO as a foil to the Warsaw Pact - but that's only because they realize the Warsaw Pact was a method of dominating the Eastern Bloc, which was never NATOs purpose in the West. After all, how many NATO member countries did the US invade and how many Warsaw Pact countries did the USSR invade - let's not forget that France even left NATO developed its own nukes, and only ever returned after demanding that it have to make no changes to its own command structure... essentially crippling NATO unity of command for a decade or more. Moreover, nobody wants to destroy Russia. The vast majority of Americans couldn't point to Russia on a map. Americans don't care or think about Russia nearly as much as Russians think about America, and maybe that's quite telling of the old Soviet trick, \"Повторять пока не поверят, и потом повторять еще сто раз на всякий случай.\"",
                "There was this agreement called the Budapest agreement where Ukraine gave up all their nukes for security by Russia, US, and UK not to invade Ukraine in the 1990s. In 2014 Putin invaded Crimea…a Ukrainian territory. Whether most spoke Russian there or not that violated that agreement. It’d be like Mexico invading California or the southwest because two hundred years ago it was their territory and a lot of people speak Spanish in the area. Doesn’t make it right. Everyday Russians, Ukrainians, or Americans don’t want war. We all want to live in peace and raise our families. Sometimes though a leader with too much power oversteps that peace. That’s what’s the issue, not everyday people.",

                "I know you're a troll, but let me tell you how the history of Ukraine is really taught. To begin with, the period of Kievan Rus in no way refers to Ukraine except for their current capital and the tribes living on the territory of the current central Ukraina. Kievan Rus began with Novgorod.  \nLater, the territory of Ukraine and Belarus came under the influence of Lithuania/Poland, which of course split the people who lived in these territories into two camps. By this time, the territories of the Kherson Mykolaiv Donetsk, Lugansk and Odessa regions were not inhabited. These were the bare stipi where the nomadic tribes of Tatars lived. Peasants and bandits rushed there first, both from the territory of the Russian Kingdom and from the territory of Ukraine and became Cossacks there. Russia sought to return the former territories of Ancient Russia and all those who lived there were considered Slavs/Russians with some differences in culture and language. Such differences existed in many areas of the Russian Kingdom. Moscow, as the center of the new Slavic state, imposed both its own rules and the usual dialect. For example, I can understand 70-80 percent of Ukrainian speech, so this is a dialect of the language, and not a full-fledged language. You don't call American or Australian English a full-fledged language, do you? So we don't think so either.  \nIt is difficult to say about the history of Ukraine, for a while it was united with Poland, but then merged with the history of Russia. People from the territory of Ukraine fought together with the Russians in all wars, they made scientific discoveries, wrote poetry, but then they considered themselves citizens of another country and did not divide each other into nations."

There are cities and towns where you can have 90% or 99% of Russian speakers (the numbers shifted post-2014 because it became \"fashionable\" to speak Ukrainian, but Russian is still extremely widespread).\n\nThat said, for example, all formal communication, even on the regional level, must be conducted in Ukrainian. If you're writing a request to your town council or a complaint to the police, or if a doctor is giving you a prescription, it must be in Ukrainian only. Speaking of doctors, the instructions for drugs are usually in Ukrainian only, and for older generations (who need them the most) it can be a serious problem. All movies in cinemas and most TV have to be dubbed into Ukrainian only. In the few largest cities you can have a chance of catching a movie in its original English (with Ukrainian subtitles), but pretty much everywhere else it's Ukrainian dub only. Education is conducted in Ukrainian only (at least officially, although some teachers, with the students' consent, continue to do so in Russian, but that's illegal). There are strict limits on how little non-Ukrainian content you're allowed to show on TV or play on a radio (so, for example, creating a Russian-language TV channel or a radio station that plays exclusively Russian music is illegal). Street signs, only in Ukrainian.\n\nI was finishing my master's degree in 2013, before the conflict and under the allegedly pro-Russian president in the city with nearly 100% of Russian speakers (Donetsk). I was told that my master's thesis could be in any language I wanted except for Russian. I asked, could I do it in English or French? They said yes. How about Chinese? Okay, if you manage to do that. Could I do it in... Swahili? You can try, they said. But not in Russian. They told me, speaking Russian. Not because it was some petty power trip, but for legal reasons.\n\nSo yeah. You're saying you're from Canada, so you must understand the concept of bilingualism. Imagine what would happen if French would be removed from all official capacities in Canada? If it now had all the same rights as Russian or Chinese in your country? Would people be happy about it?\n\nYou can *speak* Russian in Ukraine, but there's a lot of places where you're not allowed to *use* it.",
                "I went to Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa 6 months ago and you practically only hear Russian when you are walking around public places.   \n\nThere are laws in place about service staff needing to address you in Ukrainian if they are the first ones to speak, advertisements being in Ukrainian, most schools teach in Ukrainian, etc. In 2018 they repealed laws which allowed languages spoken by more than 10% of the population of an oblast to be elevated to official languages of that oblast (in addition to Ukrainian). \n\nBut no, the idea that Russian language was being suppressed to the extent that \"Russians aren't allowed to speak Russian\" is an outright lie/propaganda.",

I'm a Ukrainian living in Ukraine, and obviously normally I don't answer questions on this sub, but I think I can for this one.\n\nThe short answer to \"Can you speak Russian in Ukraine\" is - yes. Roughly half the country speaks Russian, a lot of things are in Russian. Me, my whole family, have been speaking Russian our whole lives, and we're just fine, nothing is outlawed. Although, in light of the recent events we're slowly switching to Ukrainian :)\n\nHope this helps!",
                "No the russian language is not banned in ukraine. Even the ukrainian president often speaks russian in his speeches.\n\nIf you go to a ukrainian shop, than they need to start speaking ukrainian with you. If you answer them in russian than they can speak russian."

Economics is the root of everything.  \n\nAfter World War II, the United States built an international trading system based on the dollar.  The Breton-Woods system was even honest at first.  the dollar was backed by gold and it seemed to everyone that it was reliable.  but in 1965, French President de Gaulle demanded that the United States exchange dollars for gold.  It was removed very quickly and soon after that the US announced that the dollar was no longer backed by gold.  in fact, now it is not provided with anything, it's just air.  everyone who does not agree with this, the United States is trying to destroy by military means.  for example, Gaddafi was definitely a terrorist, he blew up planes and nightclubs, but in addition, for example, he promoted projects to supply Africa with water and others.  But when Gaddafi announced the rejection of the dollar and plans to create a \"golden dinar\", he was immediately destroyed.  Now China is interested in destroying the dollar.  However, the US is destroying it with its own hands.  freezing Russia's assets showed all countries that keeping assets in the US is a very bad idea.  Sanctions against Russia could destroy Europe's economy.  Russia China India and some other countries have agreed to create their own payment system based on national currencies.  if China takes control of Taiwan, it will deal a very severe blow to the US economy.  in general, everything looks like everything is just beginning .."

Really stressing, especially for people that are used to simple traveling. The process itself is simple tho.  \n\r\r  \nYou arrive, head to passport control, then they see your ua documents and tell you to wait in a special area that is meant for ua citizens. Then a border officer gives you a form with different questions about your visit, and after you fill it he takes the form and your phone to check. Depending on who you are, checking varies from 6 to 24 hours. E. g. I was there for 12 hours.\r\n\nYou just sit/sleep there till they call your name to continue. While you wait you can buy snacks using vending machine and find some free water in the hall.\r  \n\r  \nBefore the final decision they interview to gather info about your life and suspicious things they find on your phone.

Info war do be like that. \n\n4) Hostility and xenophobia of foreigners also contributes to that - being constantly blamed and called a \"war criminal\" by others usually only nudges bullied and emotionally distressed people into fringe groups. \n\nAs for why people **continue** believing silly theories in face overwhelming evidence.. Well, that's kinda how humans are. Think of antivaxxers and anti-maskers during COVID - there's literally a disease that kills millions of people, and they're still like, \"*Nah, it's all fake news to control the sheeple*\". Established beliefs are really hard to deprogramm, and it takes a long time for people to sober up."

After all there were union republics *before* they merged into USSR. We might relate them to modern states... or not. No one can wake Bogdan Khmelnitsky and ask his opinion on either modern Ukraine is related to his land or not. Their succession is based only on modern claims. (Obviously Russian schools now don't have textbooks exclusive to history of now foreign states unless it's global history course where short lived entities at the territory of modern Ukraine are just not relevant)\n\nWell people often confuse political, ethnical, historiographic and identity aspects of nations and nationalties. Ukrainian politics squeeze whatever they can from the timeline to build up their identity concept, people too, but we're just not so interested in tales of old times, especially if they're about something now irrelevant.

He says:\n\n* Ukraine will not be handed back its territory.\n* Ukraine will never join NATO.\n* The US will not be involved in sustaining a ceasefire.\n\n**This is BEFORE negotiations between Trump and Putin (that do not even involve Ukraine) have even taken place.**\n\nAny single one of these things is enough to guarantee that Ukraine's future existence is completely forfeit.\n\nAsk any honest and competent analyst and they will tell you the same thing: All that these policies can hope to achieve is to delay an even greater onslaught of Ukrainian people at a future date after Putin (or whatever despot that replaces him) has replenished their forces.\n\nThe war will not end - it will be deferred to the aggressor's advantage. Millions more lives will be lost, and this doesn't even include the other flare ups that will take place all over the world as a result of US isolationism and democratic splintering. This is the path that will lead us to World War III.\n\n**This is not a drill.**\n\nThe future of our world comes down to this:\n\nUkraine still has a chance to negotiate on its own terms and prevent a scenario that will lead to even greater catastrophe. It can only do this with the full support of Western (and in particular, European) allies. In order to get that support, politicians within those countries (for the most part) have to believe that it is in their own personal interest to provide unconditional support for Ukraine - the only way that those politicians will provide that support unconditionally, is if the voters of the nations and constituencies they represent make it abundantly clear that **Ukraine is Non-Negotiable**. It is absolutely imperative that the politician believes that his or her job is entirely dependent on both the commitment and follow-through of supporting Ukraine financially, humanitarian, and militarily.\n\n**We have to rally and demonstrate like the world depends upon it, because it does. We need to get as many people as possible attending demonstrations and contacting their political representatives so that the issue cannot be ignored.**\n\nWe do not have a lot of time. February 24th will mark 3 years since russia's full scale invasion - it is the natural time that politicians will look out for in order to gauge to what degree they might be forthcoming with the issue on the national and international stages. They will ask whether or not the people with the power to keep them in elected positions are still active in their support of the Ukrainian people or if they have forgotten about them.\n\nWe need all hands on deck to make this work. If you reading this right now, share this post and the poster we have provided on all available platforms. Check the website [https://standwithukraine.org/](https://standwithukraine.org/) to find out where the nearest demonstration event is to you. If there is no Pro-Ukrainian demonstration in your nearest major city, **Seriously Consider Making One** and adding it to the map provided on the website.\n\n* Translate the poster and this post if you are able to and share it to Non-English speaking communities on all available platforms - Reddit, Twitter, BlueSky, Instagram, Facebook, even TikTok (then get rid of TikTok).\n* Bug your favourite influencers until they repost or give a shoutout to the world-wide demonstrations.\n* **Comment on this post**, seriously, just do it. Comment on every post you see that tells people about the world wide demonstrations. Just straight up start conversations with people in the comment sections. Social Media algorithms are trained to prioritise engagement, brute-force hack that algorithm.\n* Find out who your local, regional, and national political representatives are and bug the living crap out of them. Make sure they get the message and don't quit until they've made a public statement committing to supporting Ukraine with political, humanitarian, and military aid - **whatever it takes**.\n\nDon't give up. There is too much riding on this for us to lose. If we do not act now, it will not only be ourselves who pay the price for our inaction, it will be our children, and their children, and their children's children, for countless generations to come. I cannot overstate this. The fight for Ukraine is the fight for the freedom of this world. The fate of that world will be determined by the events of the coming weeks.\n\n**Ukraine is non-negotiable.**\n\nMake sure our Ukrainian brothers and sisters know that we're still here. Remind them that they are not forgotten, and that they never will be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7p83bu29gje1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d97e2c68a31ea11c801dfebb103acf7f63eb254\n\n",

                "Good. I know this is probably mostly an emotional response and a way to put pressure on the west to allow them entry into NATO, but if NATO won't sack up and accept the country that is literally doing their job in terms of suppressing russian aggression in Europe, I fully support Ukraine firing up the reactors and developing their own nuclear arsenal. \n\nNever before in the history of the world has there ever been as justifiable a reason to produce nuclear weapons as a deterrent. This isn't a case of the Iranians wanting to make a nuke to kill all the jews, or NK wanting to keep their dear leader in power via a nuke program. This is an existential threat to a country that literally had a nuclear arsenal and gave them up the country that is literally invading them. The other signees on the contract, while UA is grateful for the aid, simply aren't doing enough to help AND are holding Ukraine back from defending itself. NATO won't give a clear pathway to membership. All but guaranteed russian stools like Hungary and Slovakia will vote against them. Germany is too busy quivering in fear in the corner. Other member states can't/won't/don't have the resources to help further.\n\nUkraine has been tossing the west lifeline after lifeline to prove they are worthy of being accepted into the west's club. They fight within the rules of war and with honor. They fight within the frame of the Geneva convention. They do all of this while their opponent does the complete opposite and without remorse. They do all this while aid is drip-fed to them and when they do get it, they are forced to adhere to western fears of escalation and watch their citizen die day after day by attacks that could be be stopped by simply telling them \"yes go ahead\". Don't think I have ever witnessed an entity fight back with such restraint and within such nonsense escalatory rules before and still have a fighting chance. \n\nSimply put, UA will do what is best for itself and better to ask forgiveness later then permission now. The west has had chance after chance after chance to nip the russian problem in the bud dating back to the 90s, and still thought it was wise to do business with them and extend them non-stop olive branches. That very clearly isn't working, hasn't worked, and never will work. Russians only understand the language of force (something the west has failed to learn) and Ukraine is the only one speaking that same language. The west is so afraid of russian redlines, but perhaps it's time they learn Ukrainian ones. Show them a pathway to membership, help them get there ASAP, or learn to have another nuclear state in Europe.\n\nThe west has no one else to blame but themselves that it has reached this stage.",

The alleged shooter is Ryan Routh, an American who has previously been in Ukraine. You may see reports that he was a recruiter for the International Legion or served in Ukraine’s military in some capacity. \n\nThis is not true. He was not a recruiter nor did he serve in the military in any capacity. He did attempt to get foreign fighters to come to Ukraine, especially those from Afghanistan. However he did so without any authority or permission to do so. Random civilians can’t recruit for the International Legion; they have recruiters in the Legion who do that job.\n\nHow do I know this? While I’ve never interacted with him I have known the name a long time and been warned to avoid him. In addition because Protect a Volunteer handles flights for many legionnaires we have a lot of contact with recruiters to verify who needs a flight. Even before today recruiters had told me that he is not a real recruiter and had no affiliation with the ILDU. \n\nI post this so that if you see this misinformation, you can correct it. It is not Ukraine’s choice that this person forcefully affiliated himself with Ukraine.",

How did that work out? Now imagine Trump's entire political career had already been strangely, suspiciously aligned with the best interests of the Taliban, as has been the case with Putin.\n\nThis isn't the United States negotiating with Russia to find the best settlement for Ukraine.

                "My grandfather is in the 100's right now, and he served in the Dutch resistance during ww2. He joined  not because of sheer patriotism, but because he wanted to give either his own childern, or the childern  of other Dutch people the chance to live in freedom in case he died (and he needed the resistance for something, but the resistance worked kinda like a mafia organization, you do something for them, making you a criminal in the eyes of the Germans, before they did something for you).\n\nMy grandpa had a best friend in the resistance, his name was Hans and they did a lot together and became good friends. However, one night they planned to steal something from a warehouse, but the plan failed and they got shot at. My grandpa and other resistance members had to flee while bullets flew around him. Hans was around 5 meters away from him, but he got hit and died.\n\nGrandpa always asked the question \"why he, and not me\" he always tells us that not the best survive war, but the lucky ones. However he also told us that if he wasn't lucky, and he got killed instead of Hans, he would've gladly have died so Hans could raise his children in freedom instead of him. Hans believed in a free Netherlands, and an environment where they could live in freedom.\n\nNow Grandpa is 100, but he says he simply choose not to die yet cuz he still doesn't know what to tell Hans (and other resistance buddies) in heaven. But if he decided what to tell him, he will be dead. So if we find him dead in his sleep, he decided what to tell Hans.\n\nNot sure if this story helps you, but you have to move forward and carry on cuz your husband died because he believed your son should be raised in freedom, you should live in freedom, and the children of his warbuddies should live in freedom. He died because he believed in both you and a free Ukraine. Always move forward not for your own sake, but because he believes in you even in heaven. And he probably wants you to turn old before you can come to him in heaven.\n\nIf you have questions or want to know details you can always DM me. I visit grandpa this weekend, so if you want I can ask him a question for you."

                "Simply put, JD Vance is most anti-Ukrainian Senator in the US. Aside from his 100% anti-Ukrainian voting record, he goes above and beyond to promote Russian narratives: Ukraine cannot win, Ukraine should cede land to end the war, Ukraine is corrupt and the US is writing it blank checks. He went as far as repeating the fake story about Zelensky's yacht, and published[ this op-ed in the NYT against continuing to support Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/opinion/jd-vance-ukraine.html). I've had a personal interaction with a Senator's aide who told me a disturbing story about JD Vance laughing during a meeting about Ukraine.\n\nI know there are still some who consider that Trump might be an improvement over Biden. I know your arguments well and have written before about why I find this unlikely. Choosing JD Vance as VP makes this prospect even more remote. JD Vance was selected for his [unwavering loyalty to Trump](https://snyder.substack.com/p/trump-seeks-vice), and their shared desire to [remake the American government](https://twitter.com/AccountableGOP/status/1812940196062642365) after seizing power.\n\nHowever, JD Vance is smarter, younger and more ideological than Trump. Vance's worldview and goals are inspired by the writings of [Curtis Yarvin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin) You can read Yarvin's views on Ukraine [here](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/a-clarification-on-ukraine) and [here](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/ukraine-the-tomb-of-liberal-nationalism) - it should make where Vance is coming from a lot clearer.\n\nI urge those not indifferent to both America's and Ukraine's future to vote accordingly and talk to those around you. If you have not read Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny, it's short, and is essentially a manual for what to do as government moves towards authoritarianism.",

That friend is still on the front line and the team has taken heavy casualties. He told me that Chippy was  \"a fucking good soldier and a really good friend.\" I think he said all that needs to be said.\n\nIf you would like to help remember Chippy, this is a fundraiser for his funeral costs.

We would talk frequently almost everyday for up to four years playing Dota 2 and talking about things in the fantasy genre. Bantering about how awful the final season of Game of Thrones was, about the innacuracies of the Nilfgaardian armour in the Witcher Netflix series. He was also writing a fantasy book, he would often come to me to share his ideas and ask for mine since I was just worldbuilding for the fun of it.\n\n\nOur communications drifted after he joined the war, and after a while his absence was felt in my life so I tried reaching out to him. A few days before he died we played our final game of Dota 2 together. It was almost unplayable on 280 ping but I still had fun catching up with him. I'll cherish that final game of closure.\n\n\nDevastating to know that we will never hear any new fantastical ideas he comes up with again, our plans to meet in person forever gone and never having my Crusader MMR midlaner partner in my ranked games again...\n\n\nRest well FFF."

We need to make sure Ukraine has what is necessary for as long as necessary, because we cannot allow Putin to win this war,” the prime minister said.\n\nRussia, however, accused the west of escalation and said that Biden risked adding “fuel to the fire” in Ukraine, and while Donald Trump remained silent on the issue, his son Don Jr accused the military industrial complex of wanting to get “world war three going”.\n\nStorm Shadow missiles have a range of about 250km, similar to the US Atacms, and have in the past been given to Kyiv by the UK and France to strike targets inside Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders.\n\nBut the US retained an effective veto on their use because it supplies a guidance system and repeated lobbying by the UK had failed to shift the US position, which has only begun to soften after the election victory of Donald Trump earlier this month.",

We're in this one way or another whether we'd like to be or not, and not investing now will cost us more in money and lives later. In the highly probable event of another Trump presidency, Putin may be tempted to take his chance with another country less well equipped, like Moldova or revisiting Georgia. And if that works, and if Trump looks like he'll let him get away with it, and if he continues to be fed what he wants to hear by his own intelligence services, he might try the same with a NATO country (especially if Trump pulls the US out of NATO). That sounds insane but Putin is not known for his rational nature at this point. Best to wear them down now rather than having to face them ourselves later.\n\nEven from a purely economic point of view, the cost in raised food prices from a full occupation of Ukraine alone would be more to the British public than the taxes spent on arms to prevent that."

A well meaning nightmare and they are begging people to just send money to the Red Cross, UNHCR or DEC.\n\nPartly because of logistics but also partly because this isn’t a refugee camp in a desert we are supporting where you can’t source anything locally. A metric fuck ton of all this aid will end up being sold in Poland and Moldova etc.\n\nIf you pack up a load of boxes of random shit all that happens is it’s sits there until a volunteer can unpack it, list all the contents and repack it in an organised way with all the paperwork and absolutely everything documented properly.\n\nFolks want to slips sweets into the pockets of kids jackets. Awesome, except if a random inspection finds sweets in a package and they aren’t listed the whole fucking truck is stopped and every box opened delaying the whole lot and probably the three other trucks they also sent in convoy.\n\n\nHalf of you fucks voted for this shit and this is the new reality. Wake the fuck up. This isn’t like the old days anymore. We fucked that up spectacularly and so my house is full of shit from well meaning people who don’t realise we left Europe, there’s literally thousands upon thousands of tons of stuff that basically a handful of people around the country are working balls out to organise and document \n\nIf you want to help please do, but send money to the big funds, or think about giving up just an hour to go help sort out boxes locally \n\nAnd slap the first person you see who moans about the paperwork",

Major land wars in Europe are extremely unusual and don’t happen very often (arguably the last major land war in Europe was the Second World War). On the other hand, wars in places like the Middle East and Africa are common, so don’t get as much news coverage (news is supposed to be _new_)\n\n- Social media. The Ukraine conflict is all over social media, and theres so much footage that we’re pretty much watching it happen live. This is not the case for many conflicts in poorer countries where fewer people use social media and have smartphones (although there are plenty of youtube videos). \n\n- The speed of the deterioration. Ukraine has gone from being a middle income country to a warzone in only a couple of days. \n\n- The overwhelming numbers of the Russian army. People love “David vs Goliath” stories. \n\n- The nuclear factor. Although extremely unlikely, there is a very small chance this could end with most of the planet becoming radioactive.\n\n- Demographics. Ukraine has stopped all their fighting age men from leaving, prioritising the evacuation of women and children. On the other hand, refugees from the middle east and Africa have been mostly young men. This has raised a couple of eyebrows as to whether they are in fact economic migrants, as economic migrants tend to be mostly young-middle aged men, but one would expect refugees to either contain a spread of ages and even mix of genders, or mainly be women and children. \n\nThere are many more factors, but putting it all down to racism is too simplistic (and often an attempt to smear those who care about the war in Ukraine). It’s also unreasonable to expect everyone to care equally about everything.\n\nEdit: And many people _did_ care about these other wars- for example, the war in Iraq triggered some of the largest protests in modern history.",

There is a reason that Europe continues to rely so heavily on the US for defence, and that reason is that historically US administrations have **wanted** us to. American foreign policy is the default western foreign policy, and that privileged position is bought largely through the outsourcing of defence matters to the US - that doesn't just include physical defence of Europe but also the ability to project force abroad to influence events around the world. They're the ones who can affect things, so they're the ones who get to decide in what manner things should be affected. \n\nThe corollary to a resurge in European defence spending is that Europe's going to be significantly less willing to toe the US line when it comes to making foreign and defence policy decisions, and I don't think that that's fully appreciated by those advocating it in the states.\n\nAll that said though, in principle from a UK point of view I think that that's fine in the long term. I think if Europe rebuilds both its military and defence-industrial capabilities to the point that we can guarantee our own security at home and abroad then so much the better. I don't think that necessarily includes abandoning the Indo-Pacific - there's some areas we should still be involved, particularly the industrial and technological cooperation with Australia and Japan - but if they want us to focus forces in the Atlantic and Europe - fine.",

I'm a dual British-Ukrainian citizen living in the UK. I have a family here, and I also have a son from the previous marriage in Ukraine. He's 14. He never planned to come and live in the UK, he was quite happy in Ukraine. That obviously changed and I'd like to somehow get hold of him.\n\nHis mum agreed to try and bring him to a neighbouring country (Moldova or Poland maybe), and I thought I would just go and fetch him to bring him to the UK with.\n\nReading so many news about supporting Ukrainian refugees I thought it would be a piece of cake from the legal point of view, but, alas, the only thing that the government relaxed so far is taking your immediate family member to the UK if you're a British citizen living in Ukraine:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/support-for-family-members-of-british-nationals-in-ukraine-and-ukrainian-nationals-in-ukraine-and-the-uk\n\nWhich is the right step forward, of course. \n\nBut since I don't live in Ukraine, I can only apply for the general family visa:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa\n\nWhich is quite expensive (£1,500  + £2,350 NHS surcharge), and there's no super priority option. Meaning if he escapes to Moldova and I meet him there, we'll have to apply for visa and wait for months in a country we have no connection to for a decision that might be negative.\n\nThe money is a concern, but it could be borrowed; I'm mostly worried about all that long waiting for the decision.\n\nIn any case, could someone confirm my understanding is correct and applying for a family visa seems to be our only option? \n\nIf that's correct, is there any way to try and influence the government to further relax the rules in a more meaningful way?\n\nPlease pardon my English. I'm a confident and fluent speaker of English, but it's not my native language.\n\nAlso, I know immigration is a controversial topic, but could you please try and avoid saying any mean things to me, cause the life is stressful enough even without being abused on reddit for bringing up controversial issues.",

There is a lot of backlash and uproar about it and there are petitions etc you can sign (I’m not allowed to post those in here, but if a petition gets to 100k, the government have to legally acknowledge and debate it in parliament). There are marches etc too if you want to make your voice heard though with the government we have, I doubt it will do anything I’m afraid. \n\nSaying that, if you are a U.K. citizen, so is your son? Do what you have to do to get him here even if it’s a holiday visa. I think they’ve said they are prioritising Ukrainian visas so maybe he can come here on a holiday visa until his actual long term one gets sorted.",

                "Germany was accused of a “flagrant abuse of intelligence” after revealing that British soldiers are supporting Ukrainian forces launching long-range Storm Shadow missiles.\n\nOlaf Scholz said on Monday that he would not deliver the Taurus, Berlin’s equivalent of the Storm Shadow, as it would require soldiers assisting on the ground, citing the UK and French approach with their own systems. Mr Scholz argued that following the UK would make Germany a “participant in the war”.\n\nThe comments were seen as endangering British military and diplomatic personnel on the ground.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the former chairman of the Commons defence committee, said: “This is a flagrant abuse of intelligence deliberately designed to distract from Germany’s reluctance to arm Ukraine with its own long-range missile system. This will no doubt be used by Russia to racket up the escalator ladder.”\n\nMr Scholz was also criticised by German opposition MPs.\n\n“The chancellor’s statement regarding France and Britain’s alleged involvement in operating long-range cruise missiles used in Ukraine is completely irresponsible,” Norbert Rottgen, a senior MP from Angela Merkel’s former ruling party, the CDU.\n\nMr Scholz is under mounting pressure to deliver the long-range missile to disrupt Russia’s supply lines and prevent Moscow taking further territory.\n\nHe said on Monday that German soldiers could not follow their British and French peers in “the way of target control and accompanying target control”. The Storm Shadow is co-produced by the UK and France.",

Almost certain that there will be active duty special forces and spooks engaged in actual combat operations in Ukraine too but thats going to be at the highest level of secrecy. We members of the public certainly wont know the details for decades. \n\nI imagine the soldiers talked about in the article are probably in the west of the country where its safer but I was thinking what would happen if the Russkies sent a missle at a Ukrainian base and it ended up killing British soldiers that were there?  Of course there would be an escalation but AFAIK according to the laws of war it would still be a legal and legitimate target.",

                "> A Ukrainian refugee couple who fled to the UK have been refused permission for their two-year-old daughter to join them **after the government suddenly changed its sponsorship rules**, The Independent can reveal.\n> But after finally overcoming the hurdles of **finding accommodation and setting up their own marketing business in the UK**, the couple’s submission in April for the toddler to join them was refused by the Home Office, after **rules for the schemes allowing Ukrainians to do so were tightened overnight in February**.\n\nIn a two years from a dependent refugee to a contributing one and treated like a shit.\n\n> **While previously Ukrainian refugees could sponsor family members, now only British and Irish citizens or those with permanent leave to remain can do so**. Announcing the changes on 19 February, the government said it had eschewed the typical implementation period of 21 days to avoid a “misplaced surge of applications”.\n\n> But despite their application for Anna stating they were her parents, **the refusal letter Oleksandra and Yaroslav received 11 days later on 26 April said Anna was not eligible because – as per the new rules – her “sponsor does not meet the requirement that they must be a British or Irish citizen or have no time limit on their stay in the UK”**.\n\nTalking about cruel…",

This happens quite often and legislation needs tweaking because the legal team which drew up the wording has a different opinion to those who implement it.\n\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65ccc3c21d9395001294665e/Ukraine+Family+Scheme+Guidance.pdf is the document in question, Ukraine Family Scheme Version 6.0."

                "\n\nThe British Army will on Tuesday warn soldiers not to travel to Ukraine to take up arms as it risks triggering a major escalation in the conflict.\n\nThe cautionary order comes after Downing Street rebuked Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, who said she \"absolutely\" supported British nationals fighting against the Russian invasion.\n\nIn a daily message to every soldier, seen by The Telegraph, known as a Part 1 Order, Sir Chris Tickell, the second in command of the army, will say on Tuesday: \"There has been some recent media coverage relating to foreigners being welcomed into Ukraine to help fight against Russia.\n\n\"To be clear, as members of the British Army, you are not authorised to travel to Ukraine to support the ongoing conflict against Russia in any form, whether you are on leave or not. Please remain professional and focused on your duty and your team.\"\n\nThe Telegraph understands the Army fears that soldiers seen with British insignia in Ukraine could trigger a major escalation in the conflict.\n\nCommanders were last night warned of \"rumblings through back channels of some soldiers considering [going to Ukraine]\".\n\nThe internal memo said that not only would this be \"very bad from a reputational and presentational point of view\", but \"more worryingly, at its worst, it could lead to miscalculation, which we need to guard against.\"\n\nBritain has vowed not to send troops to Ukraine and any deployment, even if unofficial, risks provoking retaliation from Russia and widening the conflict. \n\nIt came as Downing Street knocked down the Foreign Secretary amid warnings that British nationals might be breaking the law if they travel to fight in Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s official spokesman insisted on Monday that he “fully recognises the strength of feeling” among Britons who want to help, but reiterated the Government's advice not to travel to Ukraine.\n\nBen Wallace, the Defence Secretary, also urged Britons not to join the fighting, saying that the \"very dangerous\" situation could lead to them being killed.\n\nA Foreign Office source admitted that there could be legal consequences for Britons who travel to Ukraine to fight against the Russians.\n\n“It is legally murky”, the source said, adding those who go out to Ukraine to fight “do so at their own risk, legally or otherwise”.\n\nThe Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 makes it illegal for a British citizen to fight in a war involving a nation state which is at peace with the UK. But experts say that in practice this piece of legislation is not always applied and is unlikely to be in the case of Ukraine.\n\nEd Arnold, research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute, said the nineteenth century law was “not particularly enforced” when thousands of Britons went to join the Spanish civil war in the 1930s, nor is it currently enforced against dual nationals who are conscripted to fight in foreign armies such as the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\n**Foreign legionnaires: Veterans buy kit at Army surplus stores en route to Ukraine**\n\nThey are heading to Ukraine with years of experience under their belts. But first they need to buy a belt. And fatigues. And a flak jacket.\n\nHundreds of Britons with military experience are believed to be readying to enter Ukraine as part of the country’s new army of foreign legionnaires to bolster the fight against Russian troops that invaded last week. Among them are at least 20 veterans of special forces operations.\n\nFew of them still have their own kit, however, prompting last-minute shopping trips to army surplus stores.\n\nAt Folkestone’s G4 Echelon Military Supplies, owner Damon Warren - a 52-year-old ex-soldier - is giving a 50 per cent discount to both Ukrainians and any British veterans seeking to help them. Ever since the invasion began, Mr Warren said his phone had been ringing incessantly.\n\nAmong the callers is Andrew Lester, a 25-year-old electrician from Kent who served in the Parachute Regiment till last July, reaching the rank of lance corporal. Mr Lester has his own boots, but he needs a helmet, body armour, and gear for cold and wet conditions.\n\n“The Ukrainians are really doing quite well, I think,” he said. “They’re holding out. If they need a few more blokes to push them” – the Russians – “back, then that’s what we’re here for.”\n\nMr Lester said he knew of more than 100 former soldiers who were also planning to join the fight against Vladimir Putin’s “outrageous” invasion: “If it was the UK, I’d like help from other countries. So why not, eh?”\n\nUkrainian civilians might not have experience of handling military equipment, Mr Lester added, meaning that the expertise of British veterans could be of assistance.\n\nOwner Mr Warren said he had been turning away Britons who were not veterans because those with neither military experience nor the ability to speak Ukrainian would be “more of a liability than a help.”\n\nSome of Mr Lester’s colleagues in the group of ex-Paras hoping to fight for Ukraine are veterans of special forces missions. They include Dave Radband, 36, who was part of special forces missions in Afghanistan and Iraq and now is the director of a railway engineering company.\n\n“When you’ve got 10 tours under your belt, you’ve got a unique skillset,” Mr Radband said. “You can’t just sit around. It comes down to morals. You can’t just sit around and let this happen. They need our help, so we’ll go out and help them.”\n\nHundreds of veterans were making similar plans, Mr Radband added. Of the 30-strong group of which he and Mr Lester are a part, Mr Radband estimated that 20 had been in the Special Forces Support Group.\n\nThey had felt a call to action, Mr Radband said. “We don’t fight for ourselves. We’re protectors.”\n\nThe Folkestone store has also received hundreds of orders of kit from Ukrainians making purchases either for themselves or for their countrymen.\n\n\n\nMr Warren spent Monday at his depot handing over thousands of pieces of kit, the vast majority of which is going to Ukrainians. Four were loading boxes with uniforms when The Telegraph visited, stripping off badges bearing the Union flag under instruction from Mr Warren.\n\nMr Warren said he was making no profit from the kit he was selling. “I’ve been to war zones and I’ve seen what it does. So my heart is with the Ukrainians, and my heart is telling me to help them as best I can.”\n\nTwo of the shop’s Ukrainian customers were a pair of brothers: Andriy Batuk, 39, and Roman Svisun, 46. The brothers, each of whom has lived in the UK for several years, were buying kit that they and a friend were about to drive to the Ukrainian border, before returning to do the same thing again.\n\nThey might end up having to fight, said Mr Batuk. For the time being, they had to hurry off to the continent, laden with gear. “We have to do it, otherwise he” – Vladimir Putin – “will destroy us. We will disappear as a nation.”",

If someone was attacking England or someone was attacking my wife or my son, I would take a gun and go and fight,” he told The Independent.\n\n“This is not the place for me to fight. I’m not going to get a gun and start shooting.”\n\nThe father added: “I hate what Russia is doing at the moment. I’m definitely against the war and the war that Putin is doing. But I just want to come back home and see my family.”\n\nThe Independent has set up a petition calling on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to those in Ukraine. To sign the petition click here.\n\nRussia launched an attack on Ukraine by sea, air and land on Thursday after the threat had loomed for weeks. Since then, rocket strikes have fallen on cities and heavy fighting has taken place across the country.\n\nIn the first four days of the attack, Ukraine’s health ministry said more than 350 civilians - including 14 children - were killed.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations estimated half a million people have fled across the border so far.\n\nMr Chumak was not one of them. He has tried to cross three times - but was turned back each one.\n\nThe 39-year-old said border officials told him: “You shouldn’t be here. You should be up front fighting for your homeland.”\n\nThe UK resident, who works in a hotel in London, said he tried to explain that even though he had a Ukranian passport, he did not live there and his wife and son were in England. “My life is elsewhere.”\n\n“It is just a broad rule that all the men, regardless of the situation, are not allowed to cross the border. The scenes at the border when all the men been parted from their families, like wives and children ... it has been horrific,” he said.\n\nHe spent three nights at the border trying to cross, during which time more and more people started turning up. Temperatures were about 5C and people would have to queue for several hours to use a petrol station toilet.\n\n“The food started running out at the border,” he told The Independent. “I saw the body of a woman who literally died at the petrol station.”\n\nMr Chumak said he could not get any medicine when he started to fall ill - and ended up returning back to his parents’ home several hours inland to recover.\n\nHe will wait there and try and find a way to come back home to London “at the first opportunity”.\n\n“It is just not my place to fight,” the father-of-one said.\n\nHis British wife, Nicola O’Donnell, told The Independent, she had been in touch with embassies and the Foreign Office to try and get her husband - who has indefinite leave to remain in the UK - back home, but had not had any luck so far.\n\n“Everybody’s says he’s not British, there’s nothing we can do. They were not very helpful,” the 47-year-old, who met her husband while they were both working in Pizza Hut in Kensington, said.\n\nShe is now trying to stay positive for their 12-year-old son, who says he wants to “make his dad proud” in his football games. Mr Chumak manages his son’s football team.\n\nThe Foreign Office declined to comment. The British Embassy in Ukraine has been approached for comment.",

He's scared to die, and scared to be put in a position where he might have to make the choice to kill someone. Not being on the front line is no guarantee of safety, especially when Russia has been bombing children's hospitals and orphanages. That's a very understandable and human feeling to have.\n\nAnd he has a family, with a 12 year old son. The thought that he doesn't want to leave his son without a father has probably gone through his mind, and I can't blame him for that either. I deeply admire the courage of the people who have signed up to fight but I sympathise with this guy too, and I just can't find it in me to blame him for wanting to stay safe and go home to his family."

The reality is that Putin knows his forces can achieve much more than that under a Trump presidency by just fighting. Expect him to ask for Sumy, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv and who knows what else. \n\nIf NATO membership or at the very least a peace keeping force is not agreed, then expect Ukraine to become a Russian puppet state.",

Corbyn's position is too simplistic, he is mistaken that providing weaponry will neccessarily prolong the war. Failing to provide adequate support to Ukraine could indeed result in a shorter war, but with Russian gains which would represent an increased threat to neighbouring countries and to the West. Corbyn is right in that much more effort must be put into the negotiation for peace, although it will be incredibly difficult to negotiate with Russia while Putin remains in power. It's not an either-or question; to shorten the war, increased efforts for peace must be simultaneously backed up by increased defensive capabilities. \n\nHaving said this, I think Corbyn is playing an important role, there must be somebody calling for negotiations otherwise our national postition would be purely militaristic, placing us in diametric oppostion to Russia and negating our role in the possibility for progress in any peace talks. As he has done in the past, he is placing himself in the difficult position of interlocutor, and as such will recieve a great deal of criticism as a 'sympathiser' which is clearly baseless.",

Ukrainian territorial integrity is restored, the war is won. What happens next? Sanctions come down, all the russian assets in the UK become unfrozen.\n\nNow UK owes russia interest on all these years russian money has been in UK banks. And in turn, Ukraine owes the UK interest on bonds secured against this money.\n\nSo in a sense, Ukraine will become indebted to russia by proxy of UK.

            "text": "His recent actions are more and more awkward.\n\nFirst he said that Germany would pass it's tanks as a part of larger coalition - and now he directly asks for USA to deliver their tanks before he makes a move.\n\nWhat will he do when Leopards from Eastern Europe go to Ukraine (already announced that this will happen regardless of him saying yes or no) - would he sue us to some EU court?\n\nIt's not like this war would end in this decade ( there is an issue of kidnapped people and war criminals within Russia - that Russia would not give up - they would need to send millions of their people - including all regime figures - to prisons - it's not only the teritory dispute). More likely it would last for many years - untill Russia fully colapses. \n\nWhat is his long term goal? Why do you think Scholz is doing what he is doing?",

                "I personally have no idea why he is hesitating... but I would be extremely surprised if another country sent Leopard tanks to Ukraine without Germany's approval. It would be indeed in breach of Export Control regulations... not sure there would be a lawsuit but other countries would probably stop selling critical systems or software to this country.",
                "I think the deal is pretty clear-cut: \n\nScholz does not want Germany to act in any military context on its own, as in, taking the initiative. They are waiting for the US to lead the way, for France to act first, for whatever. \n\nThere are more speculative ideas floating around which I don't buy, such as that SCholz is in Putin's pocket (the amount of Russian gas we are currently importing should prove the opposite) or that he is just a coward. \n\nI think it is much more clear: Scholz does not want to be the leader here and he does not want Germany to lead the way here.  Because he wants transatlantic approval. \n\nIts less a question of cowardice and more a question of comfortable roles. \n\nRemember that this is neither a NATO nor a UN thing - the general role structures are not here. Therefore I find it very important that it was recently the EU parliament that stacked up the heat on Scholz to deliver ( lead by the German ***GREENS*** \\- who would've thunk!). A it gives supranational scrutiny which is probably what Scholz needs  - and it gives the EU a large more responsibility and soft power, which I like very much.",
                "I rather believe official government news in that regard (not the recent WSJ unofficial sources.) \nI’m brief, no one formally asked to allow exports of Leopard tanks and or economy minister repeatedly said, he will not oppose other countries exporting their Leopards.\n\nOther than that, Germany has and is continuing with massive military support. They just don’t want to be the first in this weapon category \n\nSee also\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10fg79m/berlin_wont_allow_exports_of_german_tanks_to/",
                "Your guess is as good as ours. Scholz doesn't show his hand and we don't even know if that leaked information is really an ultimatum or just an option that was discussed and then leaked to put pressure on him. But he doesn't seem the type that easily succumbs to public pressure, so we'll just have to wait and see what the NATO meeting on Friday will decide.",
                "I fully understand Scholz at least commercially - US help is via lend lease - so someone pays US for all that - probably EU which is mostly Germany and other EU states\n\nGermany and most other EU country help Ukraine similar as Canada as a free donation...\n\nSo US is just sucking the blood out of Ukraine via lend lease and asking Germany to go ahead for free is redicolous.\n\nAs President Biden recently signed a Lend Lease Act for Ukraine, nothing Kyiv will receive is for free.\n\nThe Lend-Lease must be paid back, either through monetary means or via the use of American contractors to help reconstruct the country, allowing present loans to be rerouted back toward the US economy. For example, it took Britain and Russia several decades to pay back their lease from ww2. Both were repaid in full by 2006.\n\nSo Scholz is potentially twisted at least commercially. US needs to at least send their Tanks on similar condition as EU because in the end EU pays US for their help..."

So, if someone is rude to you, they are bad at controlling their mood, and you haven't done anything to them other than exist to earn the negativity that just got dumped on you. It still happens, but - we write that person off as an asshole and get on about our day. \n\n\nThe \"I'll be nice if I feel like it\" aspect to culture here I experience as very antisocial, because there is a truth to the way I was raised, I see it. People here can be negative under the guise of realism but the general, low-lying pessimism brings me down, and other outsiders experience it the same way. \n\n\nI find the stunting of emotions, where you are raised to be indifferent to others' emotional state, somewhat unnatural, as we are social creatures, after all. \n\n\nSo, yeah. I find making your bad mood other people's problem rude. It's nice to be nice, basically. A lot of Germans think that if you're being nice, you must be fake. No - it's not for you, it's for me. I don't want to walk around with a raincloud over my head all day, thanks, but no thanks. So after the bad interactions, I dust myself off, and I try to be nice to the next person.\n\n\nMy culture is very open, though so take it with a pinch of salt.

                "Well, that's not much of an article. It's barely longer than the headline.\n\nAs much as I understand Zelenskyy's extreme frustration -- and of course he's going to beg for membership of both NATO and the EU -- there are good reasons why, right now, this would be the wrong thing to do.\n\nEU membership isn't a thing that can be fast-tracked. Any country wanting to join the EU must adhere to a very strict set of criteria. Turkey has been trying to get in for decades but has failed to meet the criteria every time; you can't hand instant membership over to a country just because it's been invaded.\n\nAnd of course, the moment Ukraine joined the EU and NATO, those entities would themselves be at war with Russia. It's tempting to think that this would help Ukraine, because then Russia would be up against the full might of the West etc. etc., but it would amount to a declaration of war and an escalation that would give Putin the excuse he needs to deploy biological, chemical, or -- if he's insane enough -- nuclear weapons. And that's exactly what we have to avoid.\n\nUnderstand that the Putin propaganda machine is attempting to blame \"NATO expansion\" and \"western aggression\" for the invasion. He's using classic bully-boy tactics: he's trying to provoke the west into declaring war, so that he can bomb London, Washington and New York, as well as finally lay waste to Kyiv (with a small, tactical nuke, if necessary).\n\nIf there is any hope for less destructive end to this war, it lies in giving Putin a way for him to retreat while claiming victory. Time for this strategy is running out, as he is showing more and more signs of paranoia, but it can still work.\n\nHe's on the back foot, his invasion has all but stalled, Ukrainians are fighting back harder than ever, and the Russian economy is shot to ribbons. If there are any military strategists who think he could actually win, I don't know of them.\n\nSo a possible way out for Putin is for us to say that if he withdraws his troops now and stops the air and missile attacks, we can ensure that Ukraine stays neutral and then he can claim that he has successfully \"stopped NATO expansion\" and thus the \"special military operation\" has achieved its main aim. We can send neutral UN peacekeeping forces into Donbas and Luhansk, and start work on providing Ukraine with the humanitarian and economic aid it so badly needs.\n\nAnd if we can do that, then we can figure out how to get Putin in front of a war crimes tribunal. But right now, our first priority is to stop the killing, and that's not going to be done by providing Putin with the excuse he needs to kill even more people than he already is.",
                "I really understand that he's trying everything he can to stop the Russians killing even more of his people. But as harsh as that is, he must understand that other countries have their own interest to protect their people. Nobody wants a direct war with Russia, least of all NATO members. He managed to get an impressive amout of support, weapons, volunteers still trickling into Ukraine, more than any country being invaded ever got. But I think that's as far as the rest of Eurpe is willing to go. NATO will not involve themselves directly, and the EU will not just ingnore all their own rules and fast track a process with tremendous consequences for the whole union.",
                "Look, god love him, and glory to the people of Ukraine.\n\nBut if it's about a state at war (with a non-NATO nuclear power, even) not bcoming a NATO member right then, or about a state not being offered immediate membership in the EU, when it has literally all the way to still go on the acquis communitaire, then I'll gladly share in this 'blame'.",

When it became clear that I would stay in Germany for a long time, I took intensive German courses and quit my job. I also started learning front-end development on my own. Having researched the job market in Germany, I was upset: all employers require a diploma in computer science. In Ukraine, a higher education diploma is not a prerequisite for getting a job in the IT field. In Ukraine, I received a bachelor diploma in tourism business management. I have never worked in this field. I worked as a translator from Turkish (which I learned myself). And for the last 4 years I have worked at an Affiliate company as a customer service manager. After the start of Covid, I completely switched to remote work. And then the war began.\n\nSo my question is how can I find a job as a front-end developer in Germany.\nWhat do I have?  I'm currently learning German to get it to B1 level. I already feel more or less fluent in html/CSS. Now I have started to intensively study JavaScript. I'm already a little familiar with APIs and React. In the future I will also learn Typescript and .NET. My learning assistants: Odeon project, course on Udemy and, of course, Google. \n\nNow my question is: what do I need to find a job in Germany? I am a woman, I am 29 years old. I live in the small town of Rheda-Wiedenbrück, North Rhine-Westphalia. I don't have the opportunity to enroll in a bachelor's degree. Should I go and do Ausbildung? This way I can study and get some money.  But the prospect of having a minimum salary for the next three years scares me. I'm confused. Also should I do a B2 in German? \n\nPlease share your experience and advices.",

You have to sort the list and select 5 for evaluation, of which 2 actually get a chance for an interview (actual numbers may vary, rough estimate).  \n\nAmong the first of those 45 that get sorted out will be all without any formal education. A simple \"but I promise you I can do that\" is not going to fly far with selection pressure...  \n\nThere are a lot of evening courses available, or a proper \"Ausbildung\" as already mentioned. It would help.",
                "So you basically have neither credentials nor experience. Entry-level positions in IT in general, in web-dev especially, are hell even for recent graduates with Master's degrees. Without German (B1 isn't going to cut it) it's practically not possible to find anything. \n\nI'm not even sure who told people that \"learning to code\" is a viable career option in Germany for people with no formal education (credentials) or considerable experience.  \n\n>  I don't have the opportunity to enroll in a bachelor's degree. \n\nWhy not? It would actually be the best option for you, especially if you can also find some coding HiWi position which would allow you to collect a bit of experience.\n\n>  But the prospect of having a minimum salary for the next three years scares me.\n\nAs opposed to what? Didn't you say you quit your previous job?",
                "Good comments here already, but here’s another take since I know quite a few people that went that route:\n- Learn as much about FE and look for QA jobs. \n\nWhy is that? Entry levels are way easier, you know coding and general knowledge of FE so quite valuable for testings. You can get easier into companies like that, and then you pivot and offer coding skills in your team and prove you can do it. Over of course of a year you can switch to an official FE role if you’re good. This worked for few people I know who were legal and economists before.\n\nHave in mind although atm IT market is really bad, even for senior people, entry level roles and jobs are almost non existent this year and probably next year.",
                "I'd just go for it. Write some Bewerbungen, send it to a bunch of job ads, worst that can happen is you won't get in. I'd recommend B2 in every case.\n\nYou could also look for remote jobs in other cities, e.g. Berlin, there you oftentimes do not need to know German, or even other countries."

            "text": "I know its long, but its worthwhile, I promise.\n\nFor starters: I am white and from Australia. So my experiences could not be called racism. It is more subtle and harder to prove; which is why some often wonder if I am actually imagining all this. I have now lived in Germany for the past 20 years (half my life). I switched citizenship in 2016 and now possess only the German one (The German government required me to give up my Australian one!). I speak near perfect German, but with an accent. But I have come to the conclusion that Germans construct a barrier around themselves when interacting with people who don’t belong to their \"tribe\". I feel that if you were not born in this country you will never have a sense of fully belonging to German society (And even if you were born here, you may still have problems. I.e. not being white). There are always subtle traits of Germans letting you know that you are not one of them. This can involve:\n\n\\*Switching to English (I still have not yet met a German who speaks better English than I speak German; and this is not just me being egoistic). I don’t need help with my German. I am not an English teacher on wheels who gives free lessons. But this happens to me every day, even with people I have known for 20 years! But in a deeper sense I think switching to English mid conversation is an unconscious method of protecting their tribe from outsiders. I.e. the same way that a couple may have a certain (romantic/cute) way of speaking to each other alone, Germans like to protect their language and only speak it with their kind. And here I am not talking about at the Ämter or in the train (where newly arrived foreigners are forced to speak German), but rather with people I actually know and who know my German level.\n\n\\* Completely ignoring me when I ask a question. And no, this is not because they didn’t understand my German! I.e. pretending they didn’t hear.\n\n\\* Switching eye contact from me to my (German) girlfriend as soon as they hear my accent. Example: I was on holidays in Greece and we met another German couple, by chance, multiple times in a restaurant. They remembered us and offered us the remainder of their wine bottle because they wanted to go. Probably, since I was the man, they both directed their initial conversation at me. This particular time it took them a few minutes to pick up on my accent. But as soon as they detected it they seemed really confused, if not threatened. After that, including multiple other times where we popped into each other in some other villages nearby, they did not look at me and their focus shifted to my girlfriend – which is ironic because she was ignored at first for being a woman: they wanted approval from the man regarding the wine bottle!\n\n\\*Continously emphasizing the fact that you are not from Germany. \n\nAll of the above and other such similar subtle things have happened to me every day in Germany for the past 20 years. They happen too often for me to be imagining them.\n\nA lot of people say it is better in some other continental European countries. In terms of simple interactions like in a café or on the street, it is indeed easier and more relaxed in France, the Netherlands, Denmark, etc. However in terms of being accepted into society it is exactly the same as in Germany; and in Sweden or the Netherlands I would say it is even much worse (their tribes are much smaller the German tribe – so it needs to be protected even more). For example: imagine if a 20 year foreigner moves to a continental European country, gets citizenship, learns the language to near perfect, becomes accustomed to the culture, history, etc. 20, 40, 60 years later will the “native/ethnic” citizens accept this person as a German, Frenchman/woman, Dane, etc. Absolutely not, at least 90-99% of them will not. If that same people moves to Australia/ US/ Great Britian/ Canada/ New Zealand? Absolutely yes; at least, say 70-90%, will accept them as one of their own. There are two reasons for this:\n\n1.For a large portion of the continental Europe (I.e. in Germany AFD, CDU voters) nationality = ethnicity.\n\n2.For the remainder: at an absolute minimum you have to be born there, go to school there, speak the language without an accent, etc. (Auf Deutsch: “sozialisiert”). This explains why most young (progressive) Germans would actually consider a 10, 15, 20 year old of Turkish/ Italian/ Russian/ Greek/ Polish origin to be “one of them”, but do not consider me to be one of them, even if I have lived in the country far longer.\n\nI grew up in Sydney and there I knew multiple immigrants who were in the same situation as me now: they had lived about 20 years in Australiaa and were about 40. But not for a second did I even think about whether they actually belonged to this society and whether they were as Australian as me. Of course they were! But I am willing to maintain that not one of the 80 million Germans considers me as German as they are.\n\nI originally thought it was an American/Australian/Canadian thing: I.e. countries which have had huge immigration waves for hundreds of years. But that doesn’t explain why immigration is (generally speaking) much more successful in the UK than in continental Europe. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that it is an Anglo Saxon thing. More precisely an English thing: all the Anglo-Saxon countries have, internationally/relatively speaking, an English mentality. Sure, most immigrants to the US came from other countries, but these new immigrants adopted the existing English mentality very quickly. Now the question is: Why are the English (Or possibly the British) more accepting of outsiders into their society? I don’t have a definite answer to this. But maybe one possibility is that the UK has not been invaded by foreigners since 1066. There was widespread unrest and even civil wars up until 1689, but it was always Brit vs Brit or Englishman vs Englishman. Now compare this to continental Europe: Nonstop wars, tribe vs tribe, for the last 3000 years, right up until 1945, and in some cases even later: Balkans, Ukraine… Think about the 30 years’ war in Germany: the Swedish arrived, raped the woman, killed the men, burnt the villages and stole the harvest. The Spanish did the same thing the Netherlands for 80 years from 1568 onwards. And Germans of course were the experts in this field. All these conflicts involved one tribe against another tribe right up until 1945, and in terms of the historical mentality, it is very very recent. 1066, however, is a long time ago! Therefore, I believe in continental Europe the mentality has developed a natural defense mechanism against anything foreign. When such an encounter happens Europeans retreat into their own tribe as an unconscious protection mechanism.\n\nBy the way: Germany more immigrants as a percentage of popluation than the US and the UK! Large scale immigration to the UK also started at the same time as Germany: in the 1950's. So the argument \"we are still getting used to immigrants\" is completely bogus.\n\nSome people have mentioned to me, that that’s just the way it is in Germany/continental Europe, and that immigrants must accept this when choosing to migrate there. I.e. why should these countries change their whole mentality (assuming that this is even possible to do) because of some whining foreigners. On a superficial level this is true. Maybe I should just leave (Although I have no chance of getting back into Australia at 41 and immigrating at that age is not that easy. I.e. meeting new friends). But continental Europeans have to consider this: How do you seriously expect to compete in the 21st century if most (first generation) immigrants, including very highly skilled ones, don’t feel part of the society? Germany and the rest of continental Europe attracts hardly any Chinese, Indian, and African highly skilled workers compared the Anglo-Saxon countries. E.g., only 4% of Germany’s regular (i.e. excluding refugees) immigration is from outside of the EU. This immigration is a movement from poorer EU countries to richer ones. At some point this immigration will stop or greatly reduce, as Central Europe and countries like Spain and Portugal are growing much faster than Germany.\n\nThe most ironic thing about all of this is that I left Australia because I hated it and generally also the Anglo-Saxon mentality. This was 2003 during the Iraq war. I wanted to live in a country that was proactive on environmental issues, had good public transportation (despite the situation now in Germany its public transportation is still way better than in Anglo Saxon countries), had good bike infrastructure (see point about transportation), free health care, didn’t start wars, that had citizens who were were informed on world issues. And to be fair, I got all of these things by moving here. However, all of these things are nothing compared with the need to have a feeling of being accepted. So the ironic thing is that each day I am developing a larger and larger Anglo Saxon superiority complex. I guess I am being forced to retreat into the protection of my tribe.\n\nGermany: I tried. I learnt the language to a high level, I immersed myself in your literature, film, music. I lived in 4 Bundesländer (Munich, Berlin, Greifswald, Bochum). I joined sports clubs. I joined a political party. But you never treated my any differently from just another random tourist who was in Berlin for the weekend. To save my dignity I got bitter, I (mentally) returned to my people, to my tribe.",

Basicly, you apply to study fully at the new university, then after you are accepted you ask if they credit some of your previous courses. They are not obligated to, and unless it is the exact same course with the exact same content as one you would have to take, it is unlikely to happen. \n\n> Is it possible (though kinda scummy) to apply for a uni just to cross the border and then leave it instantly?

Life's good with Merkel, so why change anything?*\" ...I guess the calm spoiled them a little.  \nNow we're in a time of seemingly neverending catastrophies, many of them inflicted by the lack of decission making of the last 16 years and people are desperate to return to the quieter Merkel days. Of course the conservatives would have to take similarly unpopular decissions rn if they were in power, dare I remind you that most of the pandemic was handled by them and required taking similarly painful meassures, but it seems their voters just kinda forgot about that.\n\nThen there is the **infighting in the Ampel**. If anything it's remarkable how much they managed to get done in so little time, considering how often this happens. It's just not a good look to the public, people interpret that as a lack of control. It certainly doesn't help that Scholz is barely present as the leader of the gov't to step in and only ever pops up in the news when he loses his laptops or cosplays as a pirate.  \n\n\nA big problem is also the **lack of will to cooperate from the opposition**, especially from CDU/CSU. Whenever new laws are being discussed Merz and Söder are immediately against it, even if it means they have to contradict themselves. Not only does this complicate the process of passing laws, but it also divides the public. Of course laws should always be discussed (we live in a democracy after all) but what I'm missing from the CDU/CSU are constructive proposals on how to improve said laws. Instead they're just wildly gesturing towards some imaginative, magical \"innovation\" that fixes all of our current problems, someone might or might not have somewhen in the future or to just keeping things going as before \"*because there really are no issues*\". Well... And I guess using borderline AfD vocabulary when it comes to discussing issues with our migration system helped none of them, neither the Ampel, nor the CDU/CSU.\n\nBut imo a very big problem of the Ampel is all the (especially) **online propaganda**. The amount of alarmist, clickbait articles about any new laws the Ampel is discussing, the empty headed memes lacking any kind of substance or message which just serve to insult, and on top of that the alternative (conspiracy) media on YouTube, Telegram and elsewhere, framing themselves as \"independent truth seekers\", receiving undisclosed funding from shady sources, spreading straight up lies confirming people's paranoia.\n\nIt's even more complex then that, but I think this comment is already long enough and I guess those are the biggest problem the Ampel is facing.I personally am somewhat satisfied with them. Of course they aren't perfect, but at least were finally doing something about our problems instead of pretending they don't exist, doing nothing.",
                "The German electorate (and society) is just kinda inherently conservative, which isn't surprising given the average and median ages in Germany are around 45.\n\nProgressive and left-wing parties here usually win as a result of exceptional circumstances, such as the perceived poor handling of the pandemic, Merkel quitting politics and her successor being extremely weak in the case of the Ampel (and they still needed a libertarian party to cross the finish line). If those factors hadn't existed, we'd be looking at round 5 of Mutti right now.\n\nAnd, well, things tend to eventually go back to their original shape once the shock that has deformed them has passed.",
                "The Ampel must now do the painful steps which would have been necessary for the last 16 Years. In a very short time. So they get blamed for doing the right things."

                "Most of it is simple clickbait \"news\" reporting on any fart that anyone - no matter if they are even part of the German government - produces as fact and that the stuff they're talking about will be in Ukraine in a day.   \n\n\nMarder, Gepard - all this was talk by the Industry that they COULD refurbish and then SELL those devices if anyone willing to pay for it, and with the understanding that it will take weeks and months.   \n\n\nIn addition, many of our munitions are manufactured in Switzerland, and they are adamant to deny any re-sell/re-export of those munitions to Ukraine. How useful would a weapons system without ammunition be?   \n\n\nAs for other vehicles like IRIS-T, it was always said that they will need to be built first and can only arrive in a few months time.   \n\n\nPzH2000 require training which is now well underway, and will be in theater in a few weeks as per current estimates - as to \"only\" sending 7, that is more than was seen as reasonable by many in the Bundeswehr, considering how few we actually have in working condition.   \n\n\nThen there's the (in)famous concept of \"Ringtausch\" where Germany backfills some other NATO country so they can give their soviet equipment to Ukraine, which has created lots of controversy online, but mostly is squabbles about how much of an upgrade in equipment it is supposed to be for the countries (aka how greedy they can be) and the timeframe - for many of those units, they need to be refurbished OR built first as well.   \n\n\nAs to why other countries like Poland have given so much heavy equipment and Germany hasn't, don't forget that much of that stuff was given by Germany (for almost free) to those countries in the first place from ex-GDR stock (like the MIG29s for €1 each).   \n\n\nThere is way less flip-flopping involved if you ONLY look at statements by the actual government, not industry and other third parties.   \n\n\nCould Germany (or the west in general) do more? Absolutely.   \nStill, it feels like there is lots of Russian propaganda going around trying to open up old wounds and sow discontent between EU member states and NATO partners in an attempt to create infighting that will lead to an even weaker response to the crisis.",
                "There simply exists no case of a delivery that was first promised by the German government and then later delayed. Let's go through your articles:\n\n> Delivery of armored vehicles have been delayed according to The Guardian\n\nThe article actually says: \"(...) her government defends itself against criticism that its delay in authorising the delivery of heavy weapons is undermining the west’s unified stance\". So the point of contention is that Berlin had not authorized = promised any heavy weapons on 20 April when the article was published. The article does not say that Germany isn’t sending any weapons that were actually promised by the German government.\n\n> Germany has not sent any significant weapons to Ukraine. according to The Telegraph referring to Welt\n\nThe headline of the article: \"Germany has not sent promised large arms to Ukraine\". The text: \"Germany approved a delivery of heavy weapons including tanks in late April\". \n\nThe facts: No delivery of tanks to Ukraine was approved/promised by Germany in April (or ever). Germany approved the delivery of self-propelled howitzers. The German ministry of defense was quoted in this [6 May news report](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/ukraine-lambrecht-panzerhaubitzen-103.html) as saying that the training of soldiers usually takes 6 weeks. Another [news article reported on 11 May](https://www.dw.com/en/ukrainian-troops-arrive-in-germany-for-howitzer-training/a-61755368) that Ukrainian soldiers have arrived in Germany for the training. It is currently expected that the weapons will be delivered to Ukraine [in the next two weeks](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/innerhalb-der-kommenden-zwei-wochen-melnyk-nennt-lieferzeitpunkt-fuer-deutsche-panzerhaubitzen/28418188.html) which is in the 6-week period that was announced by the German government earlier.  \n\nI can not wait to see all the headlines in two weeks: \"Ukraine thanks Germany for keeping promise and delivering heavy weapons on time\"\n\n> Germany promises air defense systems according to DW. But none have yet been delivered according to Bloomberg and Kyiv Independent. \n\nThe air defense systems were promised on 1 June, which is less than two weeks ago. The German army does not own any of these systems, they will be delivered directly from the factory to Ukraine as soon as the company has produced them which is expected to be in October. No immediate delivery was ever promised by Germany.\n\nIf you have any other news articles which claim that Germany did not send any promised weapons, please send the link.

I purposefully won't tell his name or for which country he is a representative because of privacy issues, hope it doesn't come off as tacky.\n\nAnyway, I was submitted a file with topics (the Ambassador's curriculum vitae, presentation of Germany, its internal and international politics and today's-topics). My teacher (who's the one that drafted a couple of students to be there for the diner) encouraged us to talk to the Ambassador about what's in the files.\n\nSubjects range from the GDP, to political parties, to the Chancellor, ... to the next elections, to the far-right party, to the issues with China, to the migration crisis, to the war in Ukraine, to the rise of extremism, and.. you get it.\n\nIsn't it \"rude\" (I can't find the right word, sorry) to talk about these kinds of things at the table? Wouldn't it lead to tension and maybe some bitter aftertaste ? Especially, since we'll be encouraged to start the discussion (which is contradictory because we were also told not to speak if not spoken to, which suggests that the Ambassador will be picking the topics ?). How would you navigate this ? Would you ask questions about these topics ?\n\nI must add that I had a private discussion with my professor who said that my participation was because the Ambassador really like my \"journey\" (I'm an immigrant, and I'll leave it at that to not give out more personal information), which might imply (in my mind at least), that he'll ask me questions about my country and the politics... (which are not good... but where are they good anyway x)).\n\nAlso, I had questions about étiquette. If I'm not mistaken, Ambassadors are referred as \"Their Excellency, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany, {their name}\". If I'm making small-talk, is \"Your Excellency\" acceptable or should it be something else ?  What are the do's and the don't's at the table ?

Long wait times, email only appointments, always unavailability on phone, strong denials to speak even basic English and general dislike to Foreigners.\n\nI almost lost my job because of it; it has been 3 and half months now at Magdeburg Ausländerbehörde and still no processing of my work permit. For context, I finished my masters degree and have a contract with required salary.\n\nMy friend in another city has been waiting for visa for 2 months after processing, so she can unblock her blocked account and get access to money. Has been relying on borrowing from everyone. \n\nMy another friend also almost lost a job, because they didn't give him an appointment to change the company name on the work permit document, which BTW, they had mistakenly written down the old company's name.\n\nThis feeling of helplessness and constant worry and we don't even have a grievance forum. So many of us are facing these issues but no where to vent, no one to listen. We come to this country, ready to learn, integrate and pay the taxes. All we ask is cut us some slack and at least make the visa processing easier which is our kryptonite in a foreign country. \n\nWe are not expecting a favor, all we ask is a fundamental requirement to progress here. This is not a anger-filled post to paint this nation or its citizens in the bad light, rather a vent of helplessness.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you all for so much support, to those providing solutions, to those sharing their stories which is way worse than we have, and even people who dmed me.\n\nFrom the comments, here is the summary; \n\n- People have had multitude of different experiences\n\n- The Ausländerbehördes in smaller cities and towns are faster compared to relatively big cities.\n\n- Culmination of current pandemic, war and staff shortage has been the reason and they are overwhelmed and overworked.\n\nTo all who provided these perspectives, I can tell you we get it (atleast most of us do, there would always be aholes), we keep our patience but we have to juggle our mental health and situation while sitting with daily fear that contract revocation is a real possibility. This will also make companies very skeptical to hire foreign workers for the time being. For eg. I personally know a person who desperately needed a student-job to support themselves during their studies and even company is willing to make a contract but only after her extended residence permit arrive. I know there are other way out of that particular situation 🙂 but I am just laying out one more example of how far it goes.\n\nThe solution right now is atleast make some reasonably faster way to get the Fiktionsbescheinigung while we wait for work permit or extension of visa. \n\nu/sweetsoursop in the comments suggested a digitization of the process and even have broken it down to what is required technically ❤️. To people reading that, yes it is that simple! Other countries have implemented it and I am sure there are service based companies who actually would have done and implemented this for other countries so you don't even need to build it in-house or start from scratch. \n\nPeople also have pointed to English language and it's problems legally and some have provided factual counter-arguments to it. Personally, during my visa extensions, I never expect to hold a conversation just with English. I know a little bit of german, use deepl to translate my mails and even go with a few complex vocab and phrases memorized and anyways there's not much to talk if the process is carried out as required. But in situations like this, we have to explain entire thing to staff at the reception or to security, as most places still don't allow inside without appointments. That's why I put little English, where we can frame sentence in English with technical terms in German, and hope that they understand from the context.",

My job gave up on me after three months, but I reapplied in February and got a position by the end of March, when I had my paperwork. \n\nIt’s absolutely terrible. I’m lucky I had enough saved up from coming over from the US, or I would have been forced to go back home with nothing to show for my trip. I can’t imagine how people survive who have to wait that long with no money and nobody to help them. It’s honestly borderline criminal, in my eyes."

The other two agreed since it seems to very important to Yellow. Everything worked well for some time. Traffic was somehow under control. Just once in a while Yellow screamed: \"I'm the most important here!\". The other two asked why he thinks he is more important, and Yellow said \"Because I always come before both of you!\". Red and Green just thought: \"Well, if you are happy with it.\".\n\nAfter some time the traffic got worse and Red and Green noticed that Yellow had gradually increased the time it was burning between the other two. They said: \"Yellow you can not do that. It disrupts traffic.\". But Yellow screamed \"No, I'm important I have to burn longer than you.\". And Green said: \"Yellow we just allow you to keep your impression of being important, actually you are no more than an indicator that one of us is coming, Red and me are doing the actual work here.\"\n\nNow Yellow was really furious. \"I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU ANYMORE!\" and jumped out of the traffic light. The cars were surprised about the missing Yellow between Green and Red, even the newspapers wrote about it. But after a couple of days they all got used to it and everything worked like normal. \"What was this Yellow all about?\" people asked. Even a friend of Yellow broke up with him and help Red and Green in double shifts.\n\nUnluckily the traffic regulations require to build a completely new traffic light, if a light falls off and the other are not bright enough together.\n\nCome back in a couple of months to hear about the colors of the new traffic light and how mad and important Yellow still is.",

There's other geostrategic considerations at play here, like needing Sevastopol as at least one decent ice free harbor, albeit being in a shitty location, and the possession of Crimea being necessary to project power towards the Sea of Marmara, upgrading this harbor from \"useless wash\" to at least \"sub-optimal\", but those are secondary. Buffers is the one and only thing Russia can do to achieve at least some semblance of security in the geopolitical sense, so having buffers is non-optional for strategic survival.\n\nGermany on the other hand is not so hot on the idea. A sufficiently secure Russia via buffers and anchors at geographic barriers, able to manage internal threats with sufficient pressure, and access to open-ocean ports might very well be able to dominate the Eurasian landmass absolutely and perhaps even rise to a pretender for hegemony. \n\nNot wanting to be dominated by one another is kind of what nations *do*, so it is in Germany's interest for Russia NOT to achieve that security they seek.

            "text": "In 1994 the Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in accordance with the Budapest Memorandum.  The memorandum said\n\n\"The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine;\"\n\nConsidering that the Ukraine had the 3rd largest nuclear arsenal at the time, this was probably the biggest move towards nuclear non-proliferation ever.  Now that the Budapest memorandum has been rendered a useless piece of paper by Putin, Ukraine is probably franticly working towards reconstituting its nuclear arsenal.  They certainly have the material and knowledge to do so.   \n\nPer the wikipedia article on Ukraine nuclear weapons\n\"\nPavlo Rizanenko told USA Today that Ukraine may have to arm themselves with their own nuclear weapons if the USA and other world leaders don’t hold up their end of the agreement. He said “\"We gave up nuclear weapons because of this agreement. Now there's a strong sentiment in Ukraine that we made a big mistake.\"(http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/10/ukraine-\nnuclear/6250815/) [9] He also said that \"In the future, no matter how the situation is resolved in Crimea, we need a much stronger Ukraine. If you have nuclear weapons people don't invade you.\"(http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/the-ukraine-crisis-is-unsettling-decades-old-nuclear-weapons-agreements-20140312) [10]\n\"\nI would argue that Putin's move to reconstitute the Soviet union with Ukraine has probably in the long term reignited a nuclear arms race in Europe.  I think that the eastern european powers are working to acquire nuclear weapons given that Germany and France have no interest in protecting their borders against Russia.  Given that\n\n\"Germany receives over a third of its gas and oil from Russia and over 6,000 German firms are active there. A poll last week showed that a majority of Germans oppose sanctions against Russia. \"\n\nMy question is, do the German citizenry and government not realize the ramifications of their pursuit of short term economic goals vs the prospect a nuclear arms race in Europe?  Or do you not think that placating Putin will not have long term effects for the security of Europe?\n\nI think that what Germany and France are doing (or rather not doing) will rival the US War on Terror as one of biggest fuckups in the 21st century. Am I wrong?  \n\nI would propose that they take a hit on their economies as they progressively sever economic ties with Russia in exchange for long term security of Europe and nuclear proliferation world wide.

                "\"When goods are not crossing borders, armies do\"\n\nIt might be a simple saying, but there is a lot wisdom in it.\n\nLet me expand on that. Putin's aggression in Ukrain was done for domestic reasons. He created an atmosphere of hyper nationalism, to distract from domestic problems. That is pretty much like riding a tiger. You have to hold on for dear live or you get eaten. What has he archived? Almost nothing. While Crimea has some important naval bases, it is an economic wasteland and will need huge infrastructure investment to link it with Russia. Donetsk is somewhat more valuable. However, whatever those regions are worth in economic terms Putin over payed (maybe willingly for domestic reason). The removal of foreign investment capital by private companies alone made the whole thing a net loss. And while Germany might be dependent on Russian gas, Russia is even more dependent on German gas money. An invasion is just armed robbery on a grander scale. We willingly wire him more money, than he could ever hope to win by an invasion. Putin wont try to slaughter the goose that he depends on for golden eggs and therefore we will have peace. Unless we cut economic ties with Russia and remove the incentive not to start a war. \n\nAlso what you said about Ukrainian nuclear rearmament is idiotic. ",
                "The economic ties with Russia are a big problem, indeed. The government of Gerhard Schröder build up these ties as an attempt to get more independent from the USA. Now we see that Russia isn't the good partner our government thought it is. But it's difficult to loosen that ties in such a short period of time. An even bigger problem: The eastern EU-member-states do have even stronger ties with Russia. And they don't have such a strong economy. So if Germany and France sanction Russia even more, the eastern states could come in much trouble. ",
                "I don't see your argument. If the Ukraine decides to arm itself with nuclear weapons, it *will* arm itself with nuclear weapons, no matter what any EU member state does with respect to sanctions or other actions. \n\n> My question is, do the German citizenry and government not realize the ramifications of their pursuit of short term economic goals vs the prospect a nuclear arms race in Europe? \n\nFrance already has nuclear weapons. If you mean that Germany should also get nuclear weapons, well, if the Ukranians don't feel pretected by the French, they won't feel protected by the Germans, either.\n\nAnd BTW, the EU, including Germany, already has [decided](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/sanktionen-gegen-russland-eu-will-strafen-kommende-woche-absegnen-a-982916.html) to put sanctions against Russia into effect, it only needs to decide on the details. This will hurt Germany as much as it will hurt Russia, which is unfortunate, and it probably won't change Russia's stance at all, but at least it's gesture.\n\nIt's a difficult situation, and I don't see any ideal solution (and if I had one, I'd probably be a politician, and not posting on reddit). \n\nSevering economical ties with Russia, going back to nuclear power, and helping the US invade other countries to help US interests so they can play the biggest bully is definitely not a solution (and would make a lot things worse).\n"

Since I came to Germany as a refugee from Ukraine, not suddenly, but gradually I could see differences in my eating habits and some problems with my health. \nRight now I live at a refugee camp (moving out to a flat next week I hope) and here you can’t cook or even boil water for yourself, only at cafeteria at specified time, so I can only eat from there but I gotta say I did try to cook something myself a few times. The reason is no matter how much I eat my stomach is full but I feel hungry, and it’s not even only me. Ukrainian friends outside the camp I know have the same problems (even though they cook themselves as they said) and the people we ask in the camp said the same thing. My sister had an allergy and a few ppl I know had gastritis. I myself lost a lot of mass and right now I am close to being underweight. \nHas anyone encountered that once they’ve moved here? What did you do?\n Can someone maybe recommend nutrition deficiency tests (I think it’s called Mikronährstoffanalyse) to buy as well?\n\nEDIT: mostly a month passed, I still haven’t fixed my health problems completely, but I’ve moved to the flat already and cook myself. It feels a lot better although I do struggle to keep a balance because I have huge sugar cravings but I guess we’ll get there 😅. I feel more positive about the situation right now. I did see a doctor but still no results. Thanks to everyone for the advices!!",

And some days, she gets a pretty upset stomach from it.\n\nPeople who cook en masse often use convenience products, with many additives, instead of cooking fresh. That isn't good for anyone long term.\n\nAbout testing for malnutrition, I think it would be a good idea to ask your doctor. If you're having issues, you most likely won't have to pay for it.\n\nIf more of the other refugees get tested and it turns out you have health issues because of the food, maybe you can change something for the people who'll have to stay there, or arrive after you. \n\nGood luck, and I hope you get better soon.",

Plus the US military presence in germany is a hot topic for both sides. The right don't like them because of a perceived loss of sovereignty and an objection to American hegemony. The left for more moral reasons regarding american imperialism and military actions in the middle east. Which are both very unpopular here in basically all walks of society. The immediate post ww2 generation of west germany usually has a rather positive opinion on the US as they remember the soldiers after the war. This generation is starting to die off though and younger people don't have these memories. In my personal experience the youth is getting, politically speaking, increasingly Anti-American. Culturally speaking the US has a huge influence over the western world. US media is consumed and well liked for the most part provided that \"it's not too American.\" Which is a phrase you do hear positively remarked about new Hollywood movies for example.",

That may be older than you, but older people -- those already past retirement age -- are much less likely to be involved in this kind of scene.\n\nBeing brought up with \"a huge influence of American culture\" isn't automatically going to make you less likely to be critical of the US. In fact, if you're the type to worry that the US is trying to eradicate your own culture, having American culture such a large part of your life is *more* likely to make you think that the US is pulling the strings.\n\nIt's not really hatred of the US per se, though, more a distrust of the current US \"regime\". Movements like Querdenker are closely related to such things as QAnon , which is an American movement. The idea is that the US is currently ruled by a \"corrupt elite\" which only Donald Trump can save us from.\n\nWe have been subjected to years -- decades even -- of Russian propaganda disseminated through social media that is effectively \"brainwashing\" large sections of the population to help destabilize our societies. Once you start convincing people that the problems they face are caused by more powerful people trying to oppress them -- and this is very easy to do, because it means they don't have to accept responsibility for their own predicaments -- you can make them believe any conspiracy theory you want.\n\nAnd since it's a \"powerful elite\" that's causing all the problems in the world, who is the most powerful elite there is? Why, it's the US government, of course.",

Après la “trahison de Trump”, les Européens préparent un “sommet d’urgence” à Paris__\n\nVarsovie a affirmé samedi que la réunion, prévue lundi et organisée à l’initiative d’Emmanuel Macron, visait à discuter des défis posés par le plan de paix ukrainien de l’administration Trump. Pour la presse européenne, la rapidité de la réponse européenne témoigne de “l’ampleur de l’anxiété” sur le continent.\n\nDe plus en plus “inquiets” face à la possibilité que les États-Unis et la Russie “excluent le continent” européen des pourparlers autour d’un plan de paix en Ukraine, des dirigeants européens ont prévu de se retrouver lundi autour d’un “sommet d’urgence”, a rapporté samedi 15 février la BBC.\n\nD’après le ministre polonais des Affaires étrangères Radosław Sikorski, c’est le président français Emmanuel Macron qui a convié à Paris ses homologues pour discuter des défis posés par l’approche de l’administration Trump sur la question ukrainienne, souligne Politico. \"_Le président Trump a une méthode d’action que les Russes appellent razvedka boyem : la reconnaissance par le combat : vous poussez et vous voyez ce qui se passe, puis vous changez de position. … Et nous devons réagir_\", a déclaré le ministre polonais.\n\nOutre le Premier ministre polonais Donald Tusk, le Premier ministre britannique Keir Starmer a lui aussi été convié, selon le Daily Telegraph. Tout comme le chancelier allemand Olaf Scholz et son homologue italienne, Giorgia Meloni, précise Bloomberg. L’Elysée n’a pas confirmé la tenue d’une rencontre lundi, évoquant des «discussions en cours».\n\nLes Européens s’efforcent de faire front commun depuis l’entretien téléphonique de mercredi entre Donald Trump et Vladimir Poutine, à l’issue duquel le président américain a dit être convenu avec son homologue russe d’entamer des négociations sur la paix en Ukraine. Les alliés de l’Ukraine redoutent notamment que la nouvelle administration américaine ne “cède tout” à la Russie et d’être tenus à l’écart de toute prise de décision.\n\n__“Trop de parties impliquées”, selon Kellogg__\n\nSelon la BBC, l’envoyé spécial américain Keith Kellogg a lui-même affirmé samedi \"_que les négociations précédentes avaient échoué parce que trop de parties étaient impliquées_\", et a laissé entendre que les Européens ne seraient pas directement invités à prendre part aux pourparlers même s’ils auraient leur “mot à dire”.\n\nSamedi, dans un discours à la Conférence de Munich sur la sécurité, devant un parterre de responsables politiques internationaux, le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a, lui, “exhorté” les Européens à se renforcer pour éviter un accord forgé par les Américains “dans le dos” de l’Ukraine et de l’Europe.\n\nIl les a notamment encouragés à “créer les forces armées de l’Europe”. \"_Le temps où l’Amérique soutenait l’Europe simplement parce qu’elle l’avait toujours fait est révolu_\", a-t-il mis en garde.\n\n__“Trahison” de Trump__\n\n\"_La trahison de l’Ukraine par Donald Trump a enhardi Vladimir Poutine et coupé l’herbe sous le pied des alliés de l’OTAN_\", remarque le Guardian. \"_La réunion, qui se tiendra probablement lundi, devrait discuter des efforts américains visant à exclure les dirigeants européens des pourparlers de paix, de la position que l’Europe devrait adopter sur la future adhésion de l’Ukraine à l’OTAN et de la manière dont l’Ukraine peut se voir offrir des garanties de sécurité, soit par l’intermédiaire de l’OTAN, soit par une force européenne_\".\n\nPour le quotidien britannique, \"_la rapidité avec laquelle Macron a tenté d’unifier les dirigeants européens autour d’une réponse commune montre l’ampleur de l’anxiété en Europe face aux efforts américains visant à la fois à contrôler le processus et à exclure les gouvernements européens de toute négociation_\".\n\nPar __Noémie Taylor-Rosner__\n\n\n(__Abonnez vous au Courrier International.__)",

Faire la démonstration que oui, la démocratie libérale est plus performante qu'une autocratie corrompue, et que les légères tensions internes que peuvent connaître nos sociétés multiethniques ne sont pas un frein à se projeter à l'extérieur.  \nBref, envoyer des troupes, c'est pour combattre pas pour servir de cible, surtout quand le fer est déjà bien chaud, et que toute la chaine logistique et d'approvisionnement russe semble pâtir (ou alors il faut pendre tous nos décideurs et médias qui mentent ou se trompent depuis 3 ans : mais personnellement je ne doute pas de la corruption complète du système russe).\n\nA l'inverse, si on décide d'envoyer des troupes pour ne rien faire jusqu'au jour où elles se feront tirer dessus par les russes; alors oui, autant rester dans les frontières de l'OTAN et voir si les américains bluff ou pas.  \nIl faut quand même rappeler que si les US abandonnent les pays Baltes, alors ils perdront immédiatement toute crédibilité auprès des coréens, des japonais, des taïwanais, des philippines, bref de tous les membres de leur coalition asiatique qui vont s'empresser d'aller voir ce qui se dit finalement en Chine.   \nVéritablement abandonner l'Europe au profit d'un pivot asiatique ne peut pas fonctionner.  \nSurtout qu'on peut dire ce qu'on veut, mais je pense que l'Occident est encore vu comme une collection de pays \"blancs\" à l'international, donc je doute que des asiatiques voyant les américains abandonner des européens, les imaginent plus prêt à venir à leur aide.",

Poutine est devenu l’otage de ses propres mensonges, et cela pourrait avoir des conséquences graves pour son régime. Pendant deux ans, il y a eu des incursions à la frontière, mais aucune vraie défense n’a été mise en place.\n\nCe matin, j'ai vu que des images de MAXAR [1] montraient des tranchées en train d'être creusées juste à l'ouest de Lgov (ex: [cette image](https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/15/05/Russia_Ukraine_War_66418.jpg?quality=75&width=1368&auto=webp), aux coordonnées [51.633, 35.229](https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B037'58.8%22N+35%C2%B013'44.4%22E/@51.6330033,35.2270706,692m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d51.633!4d35.229?entry=ttu)). C'est à dire à ~45 km de la frontière avec l'Ukraine. Forcément, ils ne vont pas construire leurs fortifications sous le feu, donc il n'est pas étonnant que cette distance soit bien supérieure à celle du terrain contrôlé par l'armée ukrainienne (10 ou 20 km de profondeur suivant les zones). En revanche, cela semble montrer qu'ils s'attendent à ce que la présence ukrainienne dure (j'étais le premier à penser que les ukrainiens se retireraient en quelques jours). Quelle défaite pour Poutine de non seulement voir l'armée ukrainienne traverser les frontières, mais d'également devoir abandonner 50 km de profondeur. \n\n[1 - The Independant - Satellite photos show how Ukraine’s gamble on an incursion deep into Russia changed the battlefield (2024-08-15)](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kursk-map-moscow-russia-ukraine-b2596683.html)"

                "> Néanmoins je voyais l'OTAN comme étant une alliance n'ayant plus aucun sens, un reliquat de la guerre froide qui n'aurait jamais dû lui survivre.\n\nDans mon for intérieure, je suis convaincu que \"l'OTAN est en état de mort cérébrale\" de Macron en 2017 était absolument la bonne analyse à ce moment là et que ses efforts (vains) pour essayer de construire une Europe de la défense était un pas dans la bonne direction. Aujourd'hui, une Europe de la Défense qui poserait les bases d'une moindre dépendance sur les USA c'est à peu près mort (pour des raisons compréhensibles, la frilosité de l'engagement allemand, le sous-dimensionnement des armées et bases industrielles de défense européennes pour ce genre de conflits...) même si on aura potentiellement des choses intéressantes qui vont émerger (la proposition des pays baltes sur une mutualisation des achats de munition, par exemple, ou l'apparente volonté de la Suède de travailler davantage avec la France)\n\nL'autre point qui m'a déçu, c'est la myopie absolue allemande, entre leur politique de Défense débile, l'absence de géopolitique cohérente sur les questions de sécurité et le tout-économique.\n\nEdit: y a un truc qui m'a quand même agréablement surpris. Oui, je suis triste qu'en février 2023 on ne puisse pas voir de Leclerc dérouiller des T90 en Ukraine, ou des Rafale exploser des Su25 dans le ciel du Donbass (piloté par des ukrainiens, hein, la 3ème GM m'intéresse moyennement), mais bordel, on fait quand même du bon matos.

Bien sûr, il y a de nombreux acteurs qui profitent de ça dont l'état islamique et la Russie mais ça reste une guerre interne entre le pouvoir en place et des groupes opposants. Du coup, dure de vraiment prendre partis ici pour les Syriens puisqu'eux mêmes sont divisés. Ça n'empêche pas la misère et le fait qu'il y ait des réfugiés, c'est juste que les gentils et méchants ne sont pas clairement défini.\n\nTandis qu'en Ukraine, on a clairement les pauvres Ukrainiens qui n'ont rien demandés et qui se font attaqués par la méchante Russie. La, il n'y a pas de doute...\n\nOn ajoute à ça aussi le fait que les hommes Ukrainiens sont forcés de se battre pour leur pays donc les réfugiés Ukrainiens sont majoritairement des femmes et enfants.

Ils meurent seuls, ils sont les seuls à se faire bombarder, leurs militaires sont les seuls au front, leurs civils sont les seuls à se faire exécuter/violer, leurs enfants sont les seuls à se faire déporter. \nC'est à l'Ukraine de choisir son destin, pas à ses \"alliés\", et si eux décident de continuer à se battre la seule chose qu'on puisse continuer à faire c'est de leur fournir de l'armement (puisque apparemment même l'arrivée des nord-coréens n'est pas suffisante pour ne serait-ce qu'envisager un corps expéditionnaire).\n\nOn a tout fait en retard, et trop peu. \nLivraisons d'armes, envoi de chars et d'avions, formation de personnel, création d'usines,...et toujours pas d'espace aérien fermé. \nOn croit sincèrement que si cessez le feu il y a quand il sera inévitablement rompu on va se bouger le cul avec plus d'entrain ? \n\nLe seul avenir de l'Ukraine c'est dans l'indépendance de la Russie, et la seule fin possible à cette guerre c'est une défaite politique russe, pas un abandon de l'Ukraine. \nActuellement on entend de plus en plus de rumeurs sur du nucléair militaire ukrainien, et bordel de merde je prie pour que ce soit vrai.",

                "Pour mieux comprendre l'histoire des lettres de crédit, je vais faire une explication super simplifiée de comment fonctionne le commerce de matières premières.\n\nOn a un producteur de pétrole qui cherche à vendre son pétrole brut. Avant que le pétrole soit utilisé par le consommateur final il doit être raffiné. Donc le producteur doit trouver un moyer de l'acheminer à une raffinerie. Le problème du producteur c'est que la plupart du temps il n'a pas accès à la logistique pour pouvoir le faire car il n'a ni l'argent, ni le temps et ni l'expertise nécessaire. \n\nC'est là que rentrent en jeu les courtiers en matières premières (commodity traders). Ils ont soit leur propre réseau logistique, soit ils ont le capital nécessaire pour louer les bateaux, les camions et autres moyens de transport nécessaires. Ils ont généralement aussi des terminaux pétroliers pour stocker le pétrole si la demande n'est pas suffisante au moment où le producteur veut vendre (car la demande est saisonnière et la production ne peut pas toujours s'adapter rapidement).\n\nOr le fait est que le producteur veut être sûr qu'on va le payer, pourquoi est-ce qu'il aurait confiance envers le courtier avec une cargaison qui vaut des millions ? À moins que le courtier ne se pointe avec une valise pleine de dollars, il n'a pas envie de vendre son pétrole. Le problème du courtier c'est qu'il ne se fait qu'une petite marge sur la transaction, il n'a pas l'argent pour payer chaque producteur avec qui il travaille, il ne peut que les payer une fois que les raffineries l'auront payé quand il aura acheminé le pétrole à destination. \n\nC'est là que rentrent en jeu les lettres de crédit. La banque du courtier émet un titre que le courtier peut donner au producteur, qui veut essentiellement dire \"même si mon client fait faillite, je te promets de te payer dans 30-60 jours si tu lui donne ton pétrole en échange de ce titre\". C'est plus puissant qu'un chèque car même si le courtier n'a pas suffisamment d'argent sur son compte à l'échéance, le producteur sera payé par la banque.\n\nLe producteur peut alors transmettre la lettre de crédit à sa propre banque qui lui versera une avance et qui prendra en charge le règlement de la dette de la banque du courtier.\n\nAutrement dit, ça retire quasiment l'intégralité du risque du producteur dans la transaction, pour lui la lettre de crédit c'est un super chèque qui sera encaissé quoi qu'il arrive.\n\nEn interdisant aux banques russes qui sont les banques de producteurs de gaz ou de pétrole russe d'utiliser des dollars et d'utiliser SWIFT, on leur interdit d'utiliser des des lettres de crédit libellées en dollars (euros, livres et yen aussi) et de négocier facilement avec les banques des courtiers en matières premières. \n\nDonc maintenant pour acheter du pétrole russe, faut soit aller directement en Russie avec des valises de cash, ce qui n'est pas pratique du tout et comme je l'ai dit, les courtiers n'ont généralement pas ce cash à disposition, ou bien s'arranger avec des banques chinoises pour qu'elles fassent des lettres de crédit en yuan, ce qui rajoute un intermédiaire, donc baisse les marges qui sont déjà faibles et donc n'est pas idéal non plus, sachant que les producteurs russes n'ont peut-être même pas envie d'accepter un paiement en yuan.\n\nLe résultat c'est que les producteurs russes sont obligés de vendre leur pétrole et gaz au rabais et/ou prendre beaucoup plus de risque (ce qu'on appelle en finance le risque de contrepartie).",
                "[Message de victoire accidentellement publié par l'agence de presse publique RIA Novosty](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html)\n\nLa [traduction en anglais, faite par un redditeur](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2tx0g/russian_propaganda_outlet_accidentally_publishes/hyoagnf/) d'AirUkraine, est extrêmement flippante : \n\n> A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.\n\n> Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia. \n\n> Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.\n\n> Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said\n\n> Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.\n\n> The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that \"only Ukraine is real Russia,\" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when \"we lost Ukraine.\" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.\n\n> Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.\n\n> And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.\n\n> Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.\n\n> More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.\n\n> Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.\n\n> Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.\n\n> But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the \"Russian threat\" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.\n\n> Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.\n\n> China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",

                "\n>**Ukraine: les Russes reculent, la «poutinosphère» française patine**\n\n\n>Entre déni et complotisme, les influenceurs pro-Kremlin en France peinent à évoquer les revers de l’armée russe face à la contre-offensive ukrainienne de ces derniers jours.\n\n\n>On allait voir ce qu’on allait voir. Kyiv devait tomber en trois jours. Puis l’armée des «ukronazis» allait s’effondrer face à l’élan russe. Puis Vladimir Poutine, grand joueur d’échecs, avait changé de stratégie et allait renverser la table. Et puis, et puis… Et puis la contre-offensive ukrainienne est arrivée et a rebattu les cartes sur le terrain, au point qu’«on ne peut plus exclure une reprise totale du territoire», selon l’ancien colonel de l’armée de Terre et historien Michel Goya dans Libé. De quoi provoquer un grand bug dans le logiciel des influenceurs pro-Poutine français – cette sphère éclectique, d’influenceurs qui reprennent et diffusent les mots du Kremlin, parfois jusqu’à la caricature.\n\n\n\n>«La victoire sera nôtre de toute façon», lançait sur Twitter samedi le Français Xavier Moreau (37 000 abonnés), proche d’Alain Soral et administrateur d’un blog «d’analyses géopolitiques et économiques sur toutes les zones, pays et continents» très décrié pour sa désinformation. Un homme qui compte aussi près de 180 000 abonnés à sa chaîne YouTube. Quelques heures plus tôt pourtant, toujours sur Twitter, Moreau affichait une sidération teintée de pessimisme : «Fulgurante offensive de Kiev dans la région de Kharkiv. Retrait Russe. Echec militaire russe retentissant.» Un tweet rapidement effacé… pour laisser place à un discours revigoré.\n\n\n>**Poussés dans leurs retranchements**\n\n\n>Ces tergiversations illustrent parfaitement la stupeur, voire la panique qui a frappé les pro russes français à l’annonce des premiers succès de la contre-offensive ukrainienne dans l’est du pays. Une attaque éclair qui a littéralement enfoncé les forces russes, rejetées des dizaines de kilomètres en arrière de la ligne de front. Les influenceurs pro Poutine ont eux aussi été poussés dans leurs retranchements. Il y a ceux qui ont sorti les sacs de sable et décidé de tenir la ligne coûte que coûte, et les autres, qui ont décidé d’opérer une retraite discrète.\n\n\n>A l’image de l’économiste Jacques Sapir, dont le nom d’utilisateur sur Twitter, où il compte plus de 42 000 abonnés, est «russeurope». C’est lui qui, il y a cinq mois, annonçait en grande pompe sur la webtélé insoumise le Média que «l’armée ukrainienne allait s’effondrer» incessamment. Après un long silence, il ne se hasarde plus, désormais, à des analyses militaro-stratégiques. Il insiste ces derniers jours surtout sur le dynamisme de l’économie russe, pourtant lourdement handicapée par les sanctions internationales… Et se contente désormais de relayer ceux qui expliquent que «la phase 2 dans le Donbass à base d’artillerie et d’assauts urbains est terminée. Le changement de format stratégique des opérations russes est quasi acté». Tout va très bien, madame la tsarine.\n\n\n>**Dédouaner les Russes**\n\n\n>Il y a aussi, donc, le dernier carré qui occulte la portée des avancées ukrainiennes. Souvent anonymes, comme cet utilisateur twitter qui, lundi, entre deux saillies complotistes, répétait que la Russie «deuxième puissance militaire mondiale» a forcément tout calculé : «Ils peuvent rayer de la carte l’Ukraine en une matinée s’ils veulent. Mais jusqu’à maintenant ils essayent d’épargner au max les civils.» Un discours repris par quelques notabilités numériques, comme l’avocat Régis de Castelnau (32 000 abonnés sur Twitter) qui, après avoir assuré fin août qu’il n’y aurait jamais de contre-offensive, dénonce désormais ceux qui «confond[ent] contre-attaque et contre-offensive», reprenant une information non vérifiée assurant que celle-ci est «menée par des étrangers dirigés par l’Otan».\n\n\n\n\n\n>Ce narratif complotiste qui voudrait que des «mercenaires d’Academi» (la grande société militaire privée américaine, ex-Blackwater) seraient à la pointe de l’offensive ukrainienne sur Kharkiv. L’une des premières sources francophone a l’avoir évoqué n’est autre que Christelle Néant, fondatrice du site pro séparatistes Donbass Insider (près de 200 000 visites, notamment d’internautes français, en août). Une façon de dédouaner l’armée russe pour ce revers, d’en enlever le crédit à l’armée de Volodymyr Zelensky, et de véhiculer le scénario d’une guerre mondiale menée par l’Otan.\n\n\n>**«Poutine a un plan»**\n\n\n>Le dernier carré des pro-Poutine compte également dans ses rangs les fanatiques de la mouvance QAnon française. Ces pro Trump convaincus que l’Etat américain est infiltré, tenu même, par une cinquième colonne «pédo-sataniste» sont historiquement des grands fans de Poutine. Un homme, un vrai, qui protège son pays des «délires» progressistes et LGBT+. Habitués aux contorsions, ils font assaut de souplesse pour tenir leur ligne d’une Russie invincible. Sur le site phare de la mouvance, Qactus.fr (autour de 500 000 visites par mois en moyenne), presque aucun des derniers billets sur la guerre en Ukraine n’évoque les récents déboires russes. La situation occupe pourtant les esprits, à en croire les nombreux échanges dédiés dans leurs fils de discussion sur l’application Telegram. Là aussi, toutefois, l’optimisme règne : «Poutine n’aurait pas participé aux différents événements organisés à Moscou pour la Journée de la ville [ce week-end, ndlr] si la situation sur les fronts du NWO [«New World Order», les organisateurs du supposé complot mondial, ndlr] était critique», résume un utilisateur. Qui conclut : «L’initiative dans le cadre du NWO est passée à l’Ukraine. Poutine démontre qu’il a un plan.»\n\n\n>Bonus : chez les QAnons, en fait, on se réjouirait presque. La poursuite de la guerre et la crise énergétique mondiale qui en résulte seraient en passe de faire échouer le «great reset», ce fantasme d’un plan d’asservissement des peuples via un effondrement économique fomenté par le Forum économique mondial de Klaus Schwab.",

Je suppose qu'ils préparent un communiqué. C'est très clairement une menace nucléaire de la part de Poutine, il y a difficilement plus gros marqueur que ça.

                "Bon, je risque de m'en prendre plein la tête, mais on va essayer d'avoir un discours concret sur la question de l'Ukraine. \n\nLa problématique aujourd'hui, c'est que l'Occident (et dans une certaine mesure Zelinsky) font un pari : Ils espèrent que la Russie finisse par s'effondrer du fait d'un côté de la résistance ukrainienne et de l'autre des sanctions. Ca fait un peu plus de 2 ans que c'est la stratégie, et les Occidentaux pour l'instant cherchent à soutenir la résistance ukrainienne sans non plus trop s'engager. Et ce n'est pas la fourniture de F16 ou de Mirage 2000 qui vont permettre une victoire militaire de l'Ukraine, faut pas se faire d'illusions. \n\nDu coup, on se retrouve dans une situation où tout est gelé depuis à peu près un an. Pendant ce temps là, les Ukrainiens continuent de se prendre des missiles et des bombes sur la gueule, et leur pays d'être ravagé, tandis que la Russie ne montre toujours pas de signes de rupture, et même, au contraire, Poutine apparaît plus renforcé que jamais. \n\nDe là, trois scénarios possibles : \n\n1. Poutine a fait tapis avec son invasion de l'Ukraine et menace constamment les Occidentaux d'un conflit nucléaire. On décide de tenir le bluff et on fixe un ultimatum à Poutine : Si dans 3 mois les troupes russes ont pas quitté l'Ukraine, l'OTAN rentre dans le pays et les mets dehors avec toute la puissance conventionnelle à notre disposition. On regarde si, face à cette pression, Poutine se couche ou tente le tout pour le tout. C'est évidemment une position extrêmement risquée, vu qu'elle a des chances de mener à une guerre nucléaire. \n\n2. On considère que l'Ukraine ne pourra pas, au vu des moyens humains à sa disposition, obtenir des victoires militaires suffisantes pour chasser les Russes hors du pays. On pousse donc l'Ukraine a faire des concessions difficiles (Crimée, Donbass) pour obtenir la paix, en échange d'une intégration dans l'OTAN et dans l'UE, et des investissements massifs dans la reconstruction et la modernisation du pays, pour permettre au peuple Ukrainien d'atteindre de biens meilleurs niveaux de vie et de confort et leur offrir un meilleur avenir. Ca implique pour l'Ukraine, et pour Zelinsky, une perte de prestige immense, mais ça épargne la vie des civils. \n\n3. On continue l'approche actuelle, qui est de fournir à l'Ukraine suffisamment de matériel pour qu'elle ne s'effondre pas mais pas assez pour qu'elle puisse faire quelque chose de concret. On maintient encore pendant des années un conflit meurtrier pour les civils, en espérant que la Russie s'épuise avant nous, ce qui semble compliqué car elle bénéficie probablement du soutien chinois en sous main. Ce n'est pas une stratégie de sortie, juste un maintien du statu quo, avec néanmoins un risque dans le sens inverse d'un effondrement de l'Ukraine sur le long terme.\n\nIl est facile de soutenir la résistance ukrainienne à plusieurs centaines de kilomètres du front. Ce ne sont pas nos familles, nos amis, nos proches, qui meurent dans les bombardements russes. Ce ne sont pas nos vies qui sont en permanence sous la menace des raids aériens, des frappes d'artilleries et des missiles. Il est bien beau de soutenir l'admirable courage du peuple ukrainien sans en avoir à en payer le prix. \n\nBref, que chacun fasse son choix en conscience. Mais juste \"Soutenir la résistance ukrainienne\" sans être prêt à s'engager pleinement dans le conflit, ce n'est pas à mes yeux une position de courage. C'est une position attentiste qui se paie avec le sang des Ukrainiens.",

Il nous ressort des éléments de langage du Kremlin mensongés sans sourciller, c'est honteux qu'il en soit encore là après 3 ans de guerre. \n\nIl a toujours été nul pour toutes les questions internationales, mais après 3 ans, on pourrait penser qu'il aurait au moins appris ce qui relève de la propagande russe. Visiblement non!\n\n> Depuis plus de trois ans, les Européens et la France décident au sein de l'OTAN de suivre la politique américaine, de se soumettre à la politique américaine, qui a, en Europe, fait cette guerre par procuration, contre la Russie. Nous, on y est allés, et on a payé, et puis on est allés dans les sanctions, on a accepté de se priver du gaz russe\".\n\nDonc les européens sont seulement des suiveurs des USA et ne sont pas les premiers concernés par cette invasion, les USA seraient ceux qui nous ont imposer d'appliquer ces sanctions... C'est une réécriture complète de l'histoire (c'est pourtant pas si vieux que ça). \n\nQuant au gaz russe, dans la mesure où ce sont les russes qui nous ont coupé l'approvisionnement pendant 1 an avant l'invasion de l'Ukraine et livraient au compte-goutte au point où on avait des réserves de gaz au plus bas au début de l'invasion, c'est une sacrée inversion des responsabilités.\n\n\"On fait cette guerre par procuration\", on est donc des \"co-belligérants\" selon Roussel, nouvel élément de langage du Kremlin. \n\n> Il faut aussi revenir sur les causes qui ont poussé cet acte de guerre de la part de la Russie : cette volonté des États-Unis de faire entrer l'Ukraine dans l'OTAN, d'aller déposer ses missiles nucléaires à la frontière de la Russie en Ukraine. Il faut remettre tout ça sur la table\".\n\nCa fait 2 mensonges dans 1 seule phrase. Non, il n'y avait pas de volonté des Etats-Unis de faire entrer l'Ukraine dans l'OTAN, et encore moins d'aller y déposer des missiles nucléaires. Roussel recrâche les mensonges du Kremlin, il ne manque plus que les nazis au pouvoir en Ukraine et on avait le bingo.\n\n> Il fallait tout de suite ouvrir des négociations de paix, insiste Fabien Roussel, garantir la sécurité des Ukrainiens et garantir aussi les demandes, les exigences de sécurité de la Russie, c'est-à-dire pas de missiles américains nucléaires à la frontière russe, la neutralité de l'Ukraine et la garantie de l'intégrité territoriale du peuple ukrainien. \n\nLes Ukrainiens étaient prêts à faire des concessions, jusqu'à parler de neutralité, Poutine n'en a rien eu à faire et a gardé ses exigences maximalistes tout le long des négociations, dont certaines qui relevaient de l'invention la plus complète (dé-nazification). La garantie de sécurité et l'intégrité territoriale de l'Ukraine étaient impossible à garantir tant le début de la guerre était acté par Poutine.",

Kim a échangé une dizaine de milliers d’hommes contre du pétrole, des technologies de lanceurs ou de je ne sais quoi, mais quand on vend un cheval à un équarrisseur, on ne s’attend pas à le revoir quelques mois plus tard.\n\nEn revanche, la partie sur l’effacement des visages, je ne comprends pas trop.

Une image hélas beaucoup trop vue, qui à chaque fois en tant que père me retourne l'estomac. J'avais vomi à l'époque de la Syrie, de l'Afghanistan, de la Lybie, des traversées désespérées des migrants en Mediterranée. Le monde \"moderne\" dans toute son horreur, sa futilité.\n\nMais là - et je vais faire hurler tous les tankys, mais rien à foutre - là, il y a un élément qui me met en pétard d'une façon différente.\n\n\"Monsieur\" Poutine, tant vanté (par certains) pour sa \"roublardise politique\" contre un \"OTAN méchaaaaant\", a déclenché une \"opération spéciale\" qu'il a manifestement mis au point avec sa garde rapprochée de tchékistes (sans militaire compétent à la Vassilievski ou à la Rokkosovski) pour \"libérer\" l'Ukraine par une guerre courte, sans (trop de) bavures, comme le font les Occidentaux si décriés - en visant un gain maximum au lieu de, par exemple, se contenter d'occuper le Donbass pour refaire le coup de la Crimée et s'arrêter là.\n\nEt on assiste depuis près de deux semaines à un déferlement de, je suis désolé, un amateurisme consternant. Je cite ce que j'ai vu :\n\n\\- les VDV qui sont envoyés au casse-pipe sans sécurisation de l'espace aérien. Pas une fois, mais plusieurs fois. Et même des fois on les envoie se noyer, parce que ... parce que leur bonnet est bleu je suppose.\n\n\\- des tanks qui vont au combat avec du blindage réactif d'exercice\n\n\\- des Su-34 qui utilisent des GPS civils parce que leur Glonass ne passe pas\n\n\\- des camions aux pneus chinois pourris qui déjantent ou éclatent\n\n\\- des troupes qui communiquent via radio à 20 balles chez Lidl\n\n\\- une logistique tellement défaillante que les troupes pillent les magasins et abandonnent en pleine nature leurs tanks, tanks récupérés par l'opposition ukrainienne en territoire occupé qui parade avec en pleine journée\n\n\\- des policiers anti-émeute envoyés AVANT l'armée qui donc logiquement crèvent lorsqu'ils tombent sur l'armée ukrainienne à Kyiv\n\n\\- une incapacité manifeste à acquérir la supériorité aérienne alors qu'ils sont à putain de 10 contre 1\n\n\\- une colonne de la mort qui stagne depuis maintenant une semaine près de Kiev alors qu'elle rassemble 2 (2 !) armées blindées\n\n\\- et là je viens d'apprendre que les agents locaux du FSB achètent des cartes SIM au Franprix du coin pour annoncer la mort d'un général de la famille du second grand chef des armées à leur hiérarchie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLe seul succès opérationnel qu'ils ont eu est dans le sud, et je parie que la semaine prochaine les colonnes vont aussi s'essouffler et échouer au pied d'Odessa. Qu'ils vont donc comme ailleurs tenter d'aplatir parce qu'ils n'ont plus que la force brute comme solution. En attendant que, je ne sais pas, un de leurs généraux s'électrocute en faisant pipi sur un câble qui aura été coupé par un sabotage antérieur du FSB. En attendant, c'est massacre généralisé un peu partout, comportement odieux sur les couloirs humanitaires, et une catastrophe humanitaire sans précédent en Europe depuis la guerre de Yougoslavie. Et en Russie c'est atroce aussi, entre les mères qui apprennent que leurs fils ont crevé dans la boue ukrainienne alors qu'elles croyaient qu'ils finissaient tranquille leur service militaire et une économie qui va faire revivre les années joyeuses 90 où les gosses affamés se droguaient à l'isolant frelaté dans les rues pour oublier leur misère.\n\nEt tout ça parce que, in fine,  ces moooossieurs de la haute russe se sont montrés d'une légèreté et d'une incompétence totale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPUTAIN . Quand Assad massacrait sa population, c'était son régime qu'il tentait de sauver. Ca n'excuse rien du tout, mais il y avait un enjeu. Poutine n'était PAS dans cette situation, du tout : le pays était stable, les sous rentraient, l'industrie se modernisait, le niveau de vie progressait - avec de très fortes inégalités, mais il progressait. Internationalement, il y avait une palanquée d'options pour mettre la pression sur l'Ukraine et négocier sa neutralité, voire la reconnaissance de gains territoriaux : NordStream 2, miroiter des avantages de partenariat économique, putain même cyniquement financer une opposition à un Zelensky pas forcément plébiscité pour patiemment et tranquillement arriver à ses fins. Même l'option aggressive d'occuper le Donbass aurait fait grincer des dents mais serait passée. Mais non ! Poutine a décidé de faire son gros caca pour se faire bien plaisir, et il s'étonne de se retrouver dans la merde. Et donc il décide de pourrir la vie de dizaines, non de CENTAINES de millions de personnes parce que son cerveau fini à la pisse ne lui permet pas de trouver une solution correcte.\n\nOn a des enfants qui souffrent, des enfants qui meurent, pas par la suite d'événements cataclysmiques, mais UNIQUEMENT par incompétence crasse. Et ça va durer comme ça des mois.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJ'en pleure de rage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR on a droit à la première crise humanitaire de l'histoire causée par une organisation qui fait apparaitre la 7me compagnie comme une unité d'élite. Même les amerloques, lorsqu'ils ont renversé Saddam avec leur fausse excuse à la pisse d'arme de destruction massive, ont été capables  de prendre l'Irak sans trop de casse - l'occupation de l'Irak c'est une autre paire de manches évidemment, mais là les Russes n'en sont même pas à ce stade.

                "[Guerre en Ukraine : « le rouleau compresseur » russe risque de finir par passer, selon le chef d’état-major des armées](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/03/06/guerre-en-ukraine-le-rouleau-compresseur-russe-risque-de-finir-par-passer-selon-le-chef-d-etat-major-des-armees_6116336_3210.html)\n\n**Pour le chef d’état-major de l’armée, Thierry Burkhard, « les Russes veulent tronçonner l’armée » ukrainienne.**\n\n\nC’est la deuxième fois qu’il s’exprime depuis le début de la guerre ouverte entre la Russie et l’Ukraine, le 24 février. Le chef d’état-major des armées (CEMA), le général Thierry Burkhard, a reçu Le Monde, vendredi 4 mars, dans son bureau de Balard, le Pentagone français, situé dans le 15e arrondissement de Paris. Une heure entre deux réunions d’un emploi du temps désormais rythmé d’un côté par le pilotage délicat du retrait du Mali, et de l’autre par les combats ukrainiens et les nouveaux engagements de la France dans ce conflit d’une violence inédite aux frontières de l’OTAN.\n\nLe conflit ukrainien « faisait partie des options dès l’été 2021, lorsque j’ai pris mes fonctions », raconte le général Burkhard. « Des renseignements disaient que les Russes attendraient des conditions météorologiques favorables, c’est-à-dire qu’il fasse froid », avant d’attaquer l’Ukraine. « Le déclenchement de l’attaque n’a donc pas été une surprise », dit-il. « Le soir précédent, des informations précises ont été partagées par les alliés », selon lui. Dès que les premiers bombardements ont eu lieu dans la nuit du 23 au 24 février, « nous avons activé les mesures prévues, résume-t-il. Chaque poste qui devait être renforcé au sein des armées a été renforcé ».\n\n\nIl y a eu des divergences d’analyses en matière de renseignement entre les Français et les pays anglo-saxons, reconnaît le général Burkhard. « Les Américains disaient que les Russes allaient attaquer, ils avaient raison. Nos services pensaient plutôt que la conquête de l’Ukraine aurait un coût monstrueux et que les Russes avaient d’autres options » pour faire chuter le régime de Volodymyr Zelensky, détaille-t-il. Une forme de prudence vis-à-vis du renseignement américain, héritée notamment de la guerre en Irak de 2003.\n\n**Un nouveau centre de conduite des opérations**\n\nCes débats passés, dès le début des combats, le 24 février, la France a commencé à déployer des moyens pour s’intégrer dans les plans de l’OTAN. Dès midi, une première patrouille de Rafale a été envoyée dans le ciel polonais, frontalier de l’Ukraine. Depuis, la France continue d’y assurer deux patrouilles de six à huit heures par jour. Les Rafale décollent de la base de Mont-de-Marsan (Landes), le ravitailleur, de celle d’Istres (Bouches-du-Rhône), ils volent jusqu’en Pologne puis rentrent en France à l’issue de leur mission quotidienne. Des Awacs, ces avions de renseignement équipés de radars, partent, eux, régulièrement de la base d’Avord, dans le Cher.\n\n\nToutes ces opérations sont pilotées depuis un bâtiment flambant neuf, situé sur la base de Lyon-Mont Verdun (Rhône). Depuis l’été 2021, la France dispose d’un nouveau centre air de planification et de conduite des opérations (Capco) aux normes OTAN. Une vaste salle aux murs couverts d’immenses écrans lui permettant de centraliser aussi bien les images de drones et les frappes contre les groupes armés terroristes au Sahel que les patrouilles aux limites de la frontière ukrainienne et les missions de transport aérien pour les soldats français en train d’être déployés en Roumanie. Soit une petite dizaine de vols par jour actuellement – le Capco peut en gérer jusqu’à 150 par jour.\n\nSur une carte de l’Ukraine déployée dans son bureau, le général Burkhard développe son analyse de la situation. Même s’ils mettent plus de temps que prévu, « les Russes ont pour objectif de tronçonner l’armée ukrainienne », estime-t-il. Cette dernière dispose d’environ 40 000 hommes face au Donbass et de 50 000 autres pour tenir le reste du pays. « Mais pour isoler les premiers des deuxièmes, les Russes vont devoir engager le deuxième échelon de leurs forces », ce qui n’était sans doute pas prévu, considère le général Burkhard. En plus des carences logistiques, l’armée russe « semble avoir un sujet de combativité dans certaines unités », qui n’ont pas forcément été préparées à la haute intensité, pense-t-il. Mais « le risque, c’est que le rouleau compresseur » russe finisse par passer : une question de semaines ou de mois, liée à l’organisation de la résistance ukrainienne, évalue-t-il.\n\n**Des mercenaires de Groupe Wagner en Ukraine**\n\nD’après le général Burkhard, il n’y a pas de certitudes à ce stade sur la présence de Biélorusses sur le théâtre ukrainien. Il y en a plus en revanche du côté des mercenaires de la société privée russe Groupe Wagner, même s’il ne s’aventure pas à confirmer un chiffre. L’engagement des Wagner en Ukraine peut d’ailleurs avoir des conséquences sur les capacités de déploiement des mêmes mercenaires au Mali, qui serait désormais autour de 1 000. La Russie a par ailleurs installé une véritable « barrière antiaérienne », des Pays baltes à la Méditerranée, analyse le général Burkhard, notamment en déployant des systèmes de défense S-400 très sophistiqués.\n\nEn face, depuis le 24 février, l’OTAN renforce ses capacités. Selon nos évaluations, environ 22 000 hommes sont déployés au sol, quelque 20 navires et 125 avions pour des patrouilles aériennes ou de la police du ciel. Un vaste dispositif de la mer du Nord à la Méditerranée, au sein duquel les armées françaises, en plus de leur nouvelle mission en Pologne, vont maintenir 4 Mirage 2000 et 200 hommes en Estonie. A cet effort s’ajoutent depuis le 28 février les 500 hommes envoyés en renfort en Roumanie et, depuis ce samedi 5 mars, les moyens du porte-avions Charles-de-Gaulle à partir de la mer Ionienne. Déroutés de leur mission initiale, ces avions « pourront effectuer de la réassurance avec des patrouilles aériennes », détaille le général.\n\nSur la posture de dissuasion nucléaire, qui relève du domaine réservé du président de la République, le chef d’état-major des armées ne fait aucun commentaire. Le 1er mars, le journal Le Télégramme a révélé que la France avait, pour la première fois depuis 1981 et la crise des euromissiles, mis un deuxième sous-marin nucléaire lanceur d’engins (SNLE) en patrouille à la mer. Jusqu’à présent, un seul des quatre SNLE basés à L’Ile-Longue (Finistère) dont dispose la France assurait cette permanence. Un signal, alors que Moscou ne cesse d’agiter la menace nucléaire dans le conflit ukrainien et que ces sous-marins peuvent emporter 16 missiles (M51) chacun équipés de six têtes nucléaires.\n\n**Echange avec le chef d’état-major russe**\n\nLe niveau de vigilance a aussi été renforcé dans les domaines cyber et spatial, confirme le CEMA. Mais « aucun débordement intentionnel » du conflit ukrainien n’a été observé dans ces domaines-là pour l’instant, assure le général Burkhard. A ce titre, il observe avec attention « la guerre du narratif » qui a actuellement lieu en Ukraine. « Les Ukrainiens se sont très bien préparés en matière de résilience cyber et de lutte informationnelle. Les Russes vont découvrir ce que c’est que de remonter le narratif adverse face à ce tsunami », observe-t-il, tout en restant à la fois prudent et circonspect sur les objectifs de Vladimir Poutine.\n\nLe 4 mars, pour la première fois depuis plusieurs mois, le général Burkhard a pu échanger au téléphone avec son homologue russe, le général Valéri Guérassimov. La discussion a porté sur la situation au Sahel et en Europe de l’Est, en particulier sur la guerre en Ukraine. Une démarche dans les pas du Pentagone, qui a aussi annoncé, le 3 mars, avoir ouvert une « ligne de communication directe » avec l’armée russe, « dans le but de prévenir les malentendus, les incidents à caractère militaire et l’escalade ».\n\nMalgré le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le chef d’état-major des armées doit continuer de veiller sur le Sahel, où la manœuvre de retrait du Mali, annoncée le 17 février par le chef de l’Etat, est complexe. « Tout est mis en œuvre pour tenir l’objectif d’un retrait en six mois, déclare-t-il, c’est un vrai défi. » « Il y aura un jour d’après à préparer au Mali, comme il y aura un jour d’après pour la Russie et l’Ukraine », ajoute-t-il. A ce stade, les effectifs militaires français n’ont pas encore baissé sur place. La bonne entente avec les forces armées maliennes (FAMA) est une des conditions de ce désengagement en bon ordre et en sécurité.\n\n\nPour réussir la réarticulation des capacités françaises vers le golfe de Guinée, ainsi que vers le Niger et le Burkina Faso, destinés à être deux pays pivots, « il faut que l’on soit capable de modifier la manière dont on a été présents jusqu’alors, insiste le général. Il y a un gros travail à effectuer avec ces Etats pour savoir comment faire et les convaincre qu’il n’y a qu’eux qui ont vraiment la réponse. Cela doit être de la coconstruction ». Un autre chantier est celui de la « guerre des perceptions », selon le général Burkhard. Des groupes de travail doivent aboutir à de premières propositions d’ici « deux ou trois mois ». « Il y a donc actuellement une nécessaire et utile phase d’incertitude », conclut-il."

Ç'aurait pourtant été une réponse légitime et proportionnée à la présence de militaires nord-coréens à Koursk.",
                "Wow, il va encore rien se passer. Ils vont peut etre encore faire un communiqué avec des mots forts comme la semaine dernière",
                "Guerre en Ukraine : l’envoi de militaires européens en discussion\n\nChloé Hoorman, Elise Vincent et Philippe Ricard\n\n**Dans la perspective d’un désengagement américain vis-à-vis de Kiev en raison du retour de Donald Trump à la Maison Blanche, Paris et Londres n’excluent pas de prendre la tête d’une coalition en Ukraine, selon des modalités qui restent à préciser.**\n\nAlors que le conflit en Ukraine connaît une nouvelle phase d’escalade, les discussions sur l’envoi de troupes occidentales et de sociétés de défense privées sur le sol ukrainien, ont été réactivées, a appris Le Monde de sources concordantes. Des débats sensibles, pour l’essentiel classifiés, mais bel et bien relancés, dans la perspective d’un éventuel désengagement américain du soutien à Kiev après la prise de fonctions de Donald Trump, aux Etats-Unis, le 20 janvier 2025.\n\nLe débat sur l’envoi de « troupes » en Ukraine, amorcé avec fracas par le président français, Emmanuel Macron, lors d’une réunion entre alliés de Kiev à Paris, en février, avait suscité une vive opposition de la part de certains pays européens, Allemagne en tête. Ce scénario n’a pas été enterré pour autant. Il a même repris de la vigueur ces dernières semaines, selon nos informations, à la faveur de la visite en France du premier ministre britannique, Keir Starmer, lors des cérémonies du 11-Novembre.\n\n« Des discussions sont en cours entre le Royaume-Uni et la France concernant la coopération en matière de défense, notamment dans le but de créer un noyau dur entre alliés en Europe, axé sur l’Ukraine et la sécurité européenne au sens large », confie au Monde une source militaire britannique.\n\n***« Ne pas fixer des lignes rouges »***\n\nDes propos en cohérence avec ceux tenus par le ministre des affaires étrangères, Jean-Noël Barrot,en visite à Londres, le 22 novembre. Dans un entretien accordé à la BBC, le 23 novembre, il a appelé les alliés occidentaux à « ne pas fixer et exprimer des lignes rouges » quant à leur soutien à l’Ukraine. Interrogé aussi sur la possibilité d’envoyer des troupes françaises sur le terrain, il a déclaré : « Nous n’écartons aucune option. »\n\nCôté ministère des armées et à l’Elysée, il n’y a pas de feu vert officiel, pour l’instant, à l’envoi de troupes conventionnelles ou de prestataires privés. Mais, depuis plusieurs mois, des propositions sont clairement sur la table. Comme celle de la société Défense Conseil international (DCI), le principal opérateur du ministère des armées pour le suivi des contrats d’armement tricolores à l’export et le transfert des savoir-faire militaires afférents. Dont l’Etat est actionnaire à hauteur de 55 %.\n\nComposée à 80 % d’anciens militaires, DCI serait prête à poursuivre, en Ukraine, la formation de soldats ukrainiens, comme elle le fait déjà en France et en Pologne. Elle pourrait aussi, s’il le fallait, assurer la maintenance des équipements militaires français envoyés à Kiev. DCI a été approchée en ce sens par Babcock, une société homologue britannique déjà présente en Ukraine, pour partager les installations dont cette dernière dispose. En mai, Babcock avait annoncé que des travaux étaient « encours » pour créer un site de soutien technique à l’Ukraine, « y compris la réparation et la révision des véhicules militaires », est-il écrit dans son rapport annuel.\n\nCette coopération n’a pas prospéré à ce stade, mais elle est cohérente avec la levée officielle, par l’administration Biden, le 9 novembre, de l’interdiction des sociétés militaires privées en Ukraine. Des contractors américains peuvent désormais agir à visage découvert en Ukraine, pour la maintenance des équipements militaires envoyés à Kiev, qu’ils soient issus des stocks américains ou alliés, comme les F-16 et les systèmes de défense antiaérienne Patriot.",

                "> Interrogé aussi sur la possibilité d’envoyer des troupes françaises sur le terrain, il a déclaré : « Nous n’écartons aucune option. »\n\nV'la l'état des discussions. Macron en parle depuis le début de l'année et rien ne se fait."

Parmi eux, César A., récemment accusé d’avoir participé au passage à tabac d’un attaché parlementaire LFI, et un ex-militaire ayant participé à la manifestation néofasciste parisienne du 6 mai dernier.**\n\n\nixDix jours à peine séparent les deux clichés du même homme. Le premier qui a fait le tour de la presse et des réseaux sociaux le montre dans les travées du Stade de France le soir du 29 avril dernier, à l’occasion de la finale de la coupe de France. Torse nu, on le voit arborer une flopée de tatouages parmi lesquels une « kolovrat  , symbole représentant une double croix gammée, en vogue chez les néonazis. La seconde image, diffusée le 8 mai sur Instagram, le montre cette fois-ci en Ukraine où il s’est engagé comme volontaire pour combattre face à l’armée russe. Entre-temps, le nom de cet homme, César A., [a été révélé par StreetPress](https://www.streetpress.com/sujet/1683295666-hooligans-neonazis-tabassent-attache-parlementaire-france-insoumise-stade-france-coupe-nantes-toulouse-agression-racisme) pour son implication présumée le soir du match au Stade de France dans le passage à tabac de Théo C., attaché parlementaire LFI [dont Mediapart a recueilli le témoignage](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/120523/manque-video-theo-c-agresse-par-des-hooligans-d-extreme-droite-il-y-un-climat-de-haine-raciale-qu-il-faut). *[On en avait parlé [ici](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/138s76o/des_hooligans_n%C3%A9onazis_tabassent_un_attach%C3%A9/) sur le sub]*\n\nUn départ vers l’Ukraine motivé ou précipité par les risques judiciaires encourus ? Interrogé par Mediapart, César A. n’a pas répondu à nos questions.\n\n[A gauche, César A. le 29 avril au Stade de France, à droite, quelques semaines plus tard en Ukraine, arme à la main. © Photo DR](https://static.mediapart.fr/etmagine/article_google_discover/files/2023/05/24/20230524-img-un-neonazi-soupconne-d-avoir-agresse-un-attache-parlementaire-lfi-deguerpit-en-ukraine-2.jpg)\n\n\nC’est en tout cas ce que laissent penser les écrits de l’un de ses camarades à son propos : « De recherché par les flics à soldat en Ukraine. » Un scénario qui n’est pas sans rappeler la brève cavale en mars 2022 de l’ex-membre du GUD (Groupe Union Défense) Loïk Le Priol, principal suspect dans l’affaire de l’assassinat en plein Paris de l’ancien rugbyman Federico Martin Aramburú. Il avait été interpellé en Hongrie, à deux pas de la frontière le séparant du conflit auquel il voulait prendre part [d’après Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/mort-de-martin-aramburu-le-principal-suspect-interpelle-en-hongrie-23-03-2022-GF5RDYSIGJB7XHJ65CAHI5F5LY.php?ts=1684775085018). \n\nAyant pour sa part bel et bien atteint le territoire ukrainien, César A. s’est engagé auprès du bataillon « Revanche », une formation liée au mouvement ultranationaliste orthodoxe « Tradition et Ordre » bien en vue dans certaines sphères d’extrême droite à l’international. Il y a d’ailleurs retrouvé des compatriotes, à l’instar du néonazi lyonnais auteur du message précédemment cité, et auquel notre partenaire [Rue 89 Lyon consacre un article](https://www.rue89lyon.fr/2023/05/24/militant-neonazi-lyon-populaire-ukraine/).\n\n\n[César A. (à droite), “Kenneth”, Paul et un quatrième volontaire français en Ukraine. © Document Mediapart](https://static.mediapart.fr/etmagine/article_google_discover/files/2023/05/24/20230524-img-un-neonazi-soupconne-d-avoir-agresse-un-attache-parlementaire-lfi-deguerpit-en-ukraine-4.jpg)\n\nLui qui se fait appeler « Kenneth » est un militant du groupuscule « Lyon populaire », héritier de l’éphémère Bastion social fondé par le GUD et dissous en 2019 en Conseil des ministres. Après avoir combattu en Ukraine de septembre à novembre 2022, il est rentré quelque temps en France puis est retourné « au front de l’Est » pour « chassé du rouge » [sic] aux environs de mars dernier. Contacté via les réseaux sociaux, il n’a pas répondu à nos questions.\n\nUn profil qui fait écho aux inquiétudes des services de renseignement quant aux ressortissants français qui ont combattu ou combattent encore en Ukraine - une centaine au total selon les estimations de la DGSI, dont une trentaine de membres connus de l’ultradroite. Un parcours qui correspond également au phénomène que Mediapart décrivait [dans un article récent](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/240423/deux-neonazis-de-retour-du-front-ukrainien-arretes-en-france) : la proximité du conflit et les facilités pour voyager dans l’espace européen permettant des allers-retours.\n\nJustement, dans la soirée du 22 avril dernier, ce sont deux néonazis qui étaient [interpellés à Paris](https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/paris-deux-militants-dextreme-droite-arretes-avec-du-materiel-militaire-a-leur-retour-dukraine-24-04-2023-GFTKQ57YZJHMDBB2A5SDOKO7BU.php?ts=1682341388501) de retour du front ukrainien. Dans leurs sacs, ils transportaient des chargeurs de fusil d’assaut et des optiques de visée classés en armes de guerre. L’un, Guillaume A. a croisé le chemin de « Kenneth » en Ukraine, au moins le temps de prendre la pose conjointement en effectuant un salut nazi. Le second, Alan V., était un ancien militaire renvoyé de l’armée après avoir été épinglé par Mediapart [dans une enquête publiée](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/080720/des-neonazis-font-carriere-dans-l-armee-francaise) en juillet 2020. Une carrière similaire à celle d’un homme que nous appellerons Paul, un autre comparse de « Kenneth » et César A., lui aussi fraîchement arrivé en Ukraine mais dont nous ignorons l’identité réelle.\n\nUn temps engagé au sein du deuxième régiment étranger parachutiste (2e REP) de la Légion étrangère, Paul appartient tout comme César A. au groupe de hooligans néonazis « Jeunesse Boulogne ». Militant politique, il est également membre du GUD Paris reformé depuis peu notamment sous la houlette de Marc de Cacqueray-Valménier, ex-leader du groupe dissous Zouaves Paris devenu en l’espace de quelques années une figure centrale de la mouvance.\n\n\n[César A., Paul et Marc de Cacqueray Valmenier en avril 2023 lors d’un entraînement sportif organisé en région parisienne ayant réuni de nombreux militants d’extrême-droite. © Document Mediapart](https://static.mediapart.fr/etmagine/article_google_discover/files/2023/05/24/20230524-img-un-neonazi-soupconne-d-avoir-agresse-un-attache-parlementaire-lfi-deguerpit-en-ukraine-3.jpg)\n\nCache-cou marqué de l’emblématique rat noir du GUD parfois remonté sur le visage, Paul a participé à la manifestation néofasciste parisienne ayant défrayé la chronique le 6 mai dernier. Sur les images, il apparaît aux côtés d’un quarteron de militants triés sur le volet au sein de la cour de l’immeuble où se terminait ce défilé. Là même où étaient également présents Axel Loustau et Olivier Duguet, les deux ex-trésoriers de Marine Le Pen dont la participation à l’événement a fait grand bruit [après les révélations de Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/politique/070523/les-deux-anciens-tresoriers-de-marine-le-pen-presents-la-manifestation-neofasciste-paris).\n\nContacté, Paul n’a pas répondu à nos questions. Interrogée sur sa carrière militaire et les éventuelles sanctions dont il aurait pu faire l’objet en raison de ses engagements, l’armée n’a pour l’heure pas donné suite à notre demande.\n\nAinsi, contrairement à la plupart des profils de Français engagés en Ukraine jusqu’alors identifiés par Mediapart et d’autres médias, César A., « Kenneth » et Paul bénéficient de liens solides au sein de divers groupuscules en France. S’ils ne forment pour l’heure qu’un contingent aux effectifs limités, leur exemple pourrait pousser d’autres militants à les rejoindre. À moyen terme, fort d’une réelle expérience de combat, l’influence qu’ils pourraient avoir sur la mouvance en cas de retour dans l’Hexagone interroge également.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nBOITE NOIRE\n\nContactés via les réseaux sociaux en date du 23 mai, César A., « Kenneth » et Paul n’ont pas répondu à nos questions.",
                "Tous le monde est content du coup non ?\n\nLe néo-nazis va pouvoir vivre ses grands rêves militaristes.\n\nLes Ukrainiens n'ont jamais trop de combattants.\n\nL'attaché parlmentaire vois son agresseur se faire condamner à une peine probablement plus grave que s'il était resté."

[Jean-Luc Mélenchon](https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/pour-melenchon-les-riches-sont-responsables-du-malheur-des-pauvres-20230128) est de ceux-là, rattrapé de plein fouet par le réel. *«C’est un apprenti sorcier de la géopolitique. Dès la première crise qui met à l’épreuve son raisonnement, il n’y a plus personne»*, observait un responsable écologiste il y a quelques mois.\n\nJusqu’au début de la guerre, l’Insoumis avait en réalité toujours minimisé la menace militaire russe, brandie selon lui avec insistance par les États-Unis. *«Il n’est pas vrai que la Russie soit une menace pour la paix du monde. C’est un mensonge, un acte de propagande, destiné à justifier un projet politique qui est entièrement construit sur le fait qu’il faut se regrouper face à une menace qui, à mes yeux, n’existe pas»*, lançait-il lors de la campagne présidentielle de 2017, trois ans pourtant après l’annexion de la péninsule de Crimée.",

                "Un droit de réponse de Jean-Luc Mélenchon figure à la fin de cet article*.  \n\nLa scène se passe début décembre dans les couloirs de L'Express. Après un débat tendu mais finalement fructueux avec le philosophe Raphaël Enthoven, Jean-Luc Mélenchon se laisse aller à quelques confidences. Durant deux heures, alors que les enregistreurs tournaient, le tribun a clamé avec panache son \"universalisme\", son refus des essentialismes et sa haine du racisme. Mais en off, le leader de la France insoumise livre sa vision géopolitique, aussi datée que xénophobe. \n\nMélenchon parle alors de son mépris pour ce qu'il nomme sans détour \"les Boches\". Aux yeux de Mélenchon, l'Allemagne reste l'ennemi héréditaire, qui aurait des visées hégémoniques sur l'Europe, tout en étant un cheval de Troie de \"l'ordolibéralisme\". Une rhétorique germanophobe que l'auteur du Hareng de Bismarck n'a cessé de développer ces dernières années contre ces \"teutons\" coupables d'être \"des chimistes\", des \"pollueurs\" amateurs de \"grosses bagnoles\". Bref, un \"poison de l'Europe\". Vous avez dit refus de l'essentialisme ? \n\nAujourd'hui, face à un Vladimir Poutine qui a envahi un Etat souverain et fait poindre la menace nucléaire, la principale inquiétude de Jean-Luc Mélenchon semble être le changement de doctrine de l'Allemagne en matière de défense. \"L'Ukraine ne doit pas être un prétexte pour une nouvelle course aux armements. Et surtout pas en Allemagne\", a-t-il tweeté le 26 février. Le 8 février, sur son blog, Mélenchon accusait déjà le chancelier allemand, Olaf Scholz, associé aux Américains, de saper les efforts français pour trouver une solution diplomatique à la crise ukrainienne.  \n\nRebelote le même jour : \"Deux discours dans deux couloirs, deux registres et pour ainsi dire deux vérités parallèles. Le propos de Macron est un assemblage de phrases creuses sans rapport avec les enjeux réels. Et pour cause. Pendant ce temps, les USA et l'Allemagne menaient la partie d'une nouvelle montée en tension. Dès lors, à ce moment, Macron est hors-jeu. Il ne compte pas. Poutine le sait. Et le traitement qu'il lui réserve en atteste. Le message est destiné au duo de Berlin. Et à ceux qui veulent jouer les malins.\" Tout à débusquer les stratégies sournoises de ces satanés Allemands et Américains, jamais Mélenchon n'a envisagé l'hypothèse que Vladimir Poutine, comme il l'avait depuis longtemps annoncé, ait planifié une attaque d'envergure contre l'Ukraine. \nLIRE AUSSI >> EXCLUSIF. Yuval Noah Harari : Pourquoi Poutine a déjà perdu cette guerre en Ukraine\n\nLes Etats-Unis, ou plutôt les \"Etats-Unis d'Amérique\" dans la bouche du leader de la gauche radicale, sont l'autre grande figure maléfique. Fasciné par les courants révolutionnaires sud-américains, Mélenchon n'a cessé de répéter à quel point l'impérialisme américain représenterait le principal danger dans le monde. Quitte à prendre la défense tous ses ennemis, de Hugo Chavez à Vladimir Poutine, et qu'importent leurs propres agissements. Chez Mélenchon, la diabolisation sans nuance de l'Allemagne et des Etats-Unis contraste avec sa complaisance pour le régime autoritaire de Vladimir Poutine, qu'il se refuse à qualifier de dictateur, préférant évoquer un \"autocrate\" à la \"manière de gouverner extrêmement rugueuse\".  \n\"Ce pays qui a tant de mal à en être un\"...\n\nS'il prône une sortie de l'Otan et un \"non-alignement\" , Mélenchon a régulièrement appelé à se rapprocher de Moscou. \"Si je gouvernais le pays [...], [il faudrait] construire une autre alliance et faire baisser la pression avec les Russes\", expliquait-il en 2019 sur la chaîne Thinkerview, avant d'ajouter : \"Nous faisons semblant de croire que la Russie va envahir quelqu'un, or la Russie n'a naturellement l'intention d'envahir personne, et surtout pas les pays Baltes.\" Visionnaire...  \nLIRE AUSSI >> BHL : \"Mélenchon ou Zemmour se sentent plus proches de Poutine que de leur propre pays\"\n\n\"La rhétorique anti-impérialiste, qui est profondément ancrée dans la culture politique d'une certaine gauche et d'une certaine droite, est un puissant vecteur d'adhésion à la Russie poutinienne, dont l'obsession est de se présenter comme un rempart conservateur face au néolibéralisme américain\", notait déjà le chercheur Olivier Schmitt dans Pourquoi Poutine est notre allié ?, anatomie d'une passion française (Hikari Editions, 2016), pointant une \"longue tradition\" à l'extrême gauche qui consiste à \"préférer le premier régime criminel venu aux Etats-Unis\".  \n\nChez Mélenchon, l'aveuglement idéologique face au régime de Poutine se double d'une maîtrise quelque peu approximative de la politique russe. Sur les réseaux sociaux est ainsi ressortie la vidéo d'un passage en 2017 dans L'Emission politique sur France 2. Interrogé par David Pujadas sur l'opposant Boris Nemtsov, assassiné en 2015 à quelques mètres de Kremlin, Mélenchon s'emportait alors avec morgue : \"Le personnage dont vous me parlez, avec tant de mansuétude, le connaissez-vous ? Savez-vous qui il est ? Savez-vous qu'il était un odieux antisémite ?\" Stupeur du journaliste : \"Boris Nemtsov ? Mais, enfin Jean-Luc Mélenchon, lui-même d'ascendance juive, il aurait été antisémite ? Je crois que vous confondez avec monsieur Navalny.\" \"C'est possible\", concéda Mélenchon, piteux. \nLIRE AUSSI >> Quand les souverainistes voulaient pousser la France dans les bras de Vladimir Poutine\n\nDeux ans auparavant, le même fin connaisseur des arcanes du Kremlin avait qualifié Nemtsov de \"libéral fanatique\" et de \"voyou politique ordinaire\", allant jusqu'à écrire que \"la première victime politique de cet assassinat est Vladimir Poutine\". Complotiste, il soupçonnait, sans aucune preuve, la main des Etats-Unis derrière ce meurtre, afin d'aviver les tensions avec la Russie.  \n\nSelon Olivier Schmitt, l'anti-américanisme primaire \"consiste à penser que l'intégralité des actions au sein du système international ne seraient que des réactions par rapport à ce que font les Américains. Comme les Etats-Unis sont la plus grande puissance mondiale, les autres ne se positionneraient que par rapport à eux. Quoiqu'il arrive, la cause première serait toujours les Etats-Unis. C'est une vision très réductrice, car cela enlève toute autonomie de décision propre aux acteurs locaux eux-mêmes. Dans le cas de la guerre en Ukraine, cela consiste à dire que Poutine ne fait que se défendre, mais aussi que l'Ukraine ne serait qu'un champ de bataille entre les deux empires qui s'affrontent. Comme si les Ukrainiens eux-mêmes n'existaient pas. Dans cette vision, ils ne seraient que des marionnettes, sans volonté propre.\" \n\nDans le même texte sur son blog en 2015, Jean-Luc Mélenchon ne masquait d'ailleurs pas son mépris pour l'Ukraine, ses \"nazis\" et ses soutiens américains, allant jusqu'à souhaiter la disparition de ce pays fantoche : \"Tout repose donc à présent sur le sang froid de Vladimir Poutine et des dirigeants russes. Pas de guerre ! La patience, l'écroulement de l'économie ukrainienne, la désagrégation de ce pays qui a tant de mal à en être un, tout vient à point a qui sait attendre.\" \n\n*Droit de réponse de Monsieur Jean-Luc Mélenchon \n\nL'article publié par I*Express le 1er mars 2022 sous le titre \"Quand Mélenchon souhaitait la désagrégation de I'Ukraine\" croit pouvoir qualifier la vision géopolitique de Jean-Luc Mélenchon de \"datée et xénophobe\". II s'agit d'une vision dévoyée de sa position qui doit être qualifiée de non- alignée. Cette vision géopolitique n'est pas neutre, notamment face aux violations graves du droit international que nous connaissons aujourd'hui. Les propositions de Jean-Luc Mélenchon visent avant tout à promouvoir le retour de la paix et à prémunir notre pays des engrenages guerriers. \n\nDe façon contestable, l'article ci-dessus s'appuie sur une note de blog afin de faire croire que Jean-Luc Mélenchon aurait écrit qu'iI \"souhaitait\" la désagrégation de I*Ukraine. II n'en est rien, puisque Jean- Luc Mélenchon ne faisait alors que restituer la pensée de Vladimir Poutine de l'époque. \n\nPar ailleurs, l'article ne fait pas mention de l'attachement plusieurs fois affirmé par Jean-Luc Mélenchon au principe d'inviolabilité des frontières dans le droit international, tel que cela a été le cas en 2014, au moment de l'annexion de la Crimée. II convient également de rappeler les prises de position de Jean-Luc Mélenchon condamnant très fermement l'invasion récente de l'Ukraine par le régime russe, notamment le 21 février dernier. \n\nLe 24 février, jour de l'invasion du territoire ukrainien par l'armée russe, Jean-Luc Mélenchon a constaté que \"la Russie agresse l'Ukraine\", parlant d'une \"initiative de pure violence\" et ajoutant que \"la Russie prend la responsabilité d'un recul terrible de l'histoire\".",
                "On peut aussi constater que Mélenchon reste opposé à l'envoi d'armes à l'Ukraine, après avoir flatté Poutine. Tout comme le Pen ou Zemmour, ou Ducon-Aignant.\n\nLes traîtres souverainistes. Reste à savoir si tout ces soutiens sont intéressés.",
                "Fun fact : Mélenchon apparaît dans une vidéo du compte officiel de l'Ukraine qui dénonce l'agression russe (on voit Mélenchon interviewé à Moscou par une chaîne de télé russe).\n\nIl a d'ailleurs fait un vlog où il raconte son défilé à la Place Rouge pour l'occasion en 2018. [La Russie est un partenaire, pas un adversaire !](https://youtu.be/ubIZo9hZsoU?t=1379)\n\nEDIT : le contexte -> Mélenchon s'exprime au « Défilé des immortels ». C'est une marche tous les 9 mai en Russie qui glorifie les morts de la Seconde guerre mondiale.\n\n>Immortal regiment is a state sanctioned march happening yearly. People march with flags, state symbolics and portraits of their kin who died in WWII. Looks sweet and innocent. But it conveys a powerful necrophilic message which is sublimely conveyed to the public consciousness\n\n[source](https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1503074747667603464) sur le défilé d'un thread de Kamil Galeev",

The problem here is that in the proposed US/Russia peace plan, there is no method of guaranteeing what either Russia wants (no Ukraine in NATO) or what Ukraine wants (no more Russian advances). Both can simply be done at a later date. Thus it would not be a lasting peace. The proposals to have various parties act as peace keepers (presumably on the Ukrainian side of the line of contact) are seen as a way to provide Ukraine with security assurances and decrease the chance that Russia will resume hostilities. But there is no discussion of how Russia is guaranteed that the US/NATO will not change its mind (for example in 2029 if the Dems are in office) about Ukraine entering NATO. The only thing that the US can offer Russia is the removal of sanctions against it. Which can also be reimposed, so again, there's very little reason to suppose that any peace deal would be lasting.",

Perhaps Biden doesn't want a sanction induced cost of living crisis during the mid terms, who knows. \n\nAmerica has a big strategic interest in Taiwan, in that it is a battle ground between America's only peer competitor in an area of the world where American economic interests are far from guaranteed. Were America to let Taiwan fall, that'd be the end of pax Americana and America's presence in the pacific. Not true for Ukraine and American presence in Europe.\n\nIf Ukraine returns to the Russian sphere of influence (where it has been from the end of the cold war to 2014) then America and Europe lose nothing. US-EU trade will continue, Nato will remain strong in Poland and the Baltics, and if anything might be strengthened. \n\nAt the country level, Ukraine and Taiwan couldn't be more different.

Also, there was a picture of an Ukrainian using Type 95 Assault rifles, most likely from Pakistan. In fact, the Chinese have sold tanks to both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict and others that used soviet caliber.\n\nI would not be overly concerned about this.

The video not only regurgitates the Kremlin's narrative, but it also adds this very skewed and dangerous worldview where the West is on a crusade to subjugate and enslave the Chinese race and civilization. In that narrative, Russia is basically trying to break free of the Anglo Saxon + Jewish subjugation, and is trying to protect the Russian people and Russia against the West's corruption. The video propagates that democracy is a corrupting tool to weaken and damage Russian and Chinese civilizations and that people must not be swayed by the \"color revolutions\" and Western human rights activists. The video goes on to spread many fake news particularly regarding the international sanctions against Russia, and putting a racial spin on everything. That the West is using this war to demonize the whole Russian race, and the sanctions are put on all Russians even including the pro democracy Russian dissidents living in the West. That  the racism and oppression against Russians and Chinese are what Putin is fighting against.

The comments on this video give a perfect representation of how China views Western media: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15F411x7v8/?spm\\_id\\_from=333.788.recommend\\_more\\_video.7](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15F411x7v8/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.7)\n\nThere is also this sick sexual fascination and objectification of Ukrainian women that has been very common and popular on Chinese social media for many years. Some of the popular narratives on this was that \"Ukrainian women are beautiful but poor so now that we're rich lets go and buy them all\", or \"Ukrainian women now realize that Chinese men and China are superior to the West\". This phenomenon has started to be controlled and many videos were deleted due to the discovery and attention by some outside media, but you can still find this sick objectification and crazy jingoism common in comments of the videos when you search \"Ukrainian wife\" or \"Ukrainian beautiful women\". Interesting side note is that a lot of Ukrainian women (also just white women in general) who can speak Chinese also play into this willingly to appeal to the Chinese audience.\n\nUkrainian wife: [https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AA%B3%E5%A6%87&from\\_source=webtop\\_search&spm\\_id\\_from=333.788](https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AA%B3%E5%A6%87&from_source=webtop_search&spm_id_from=333.788)\n\n\"Ukrainian beauties\": [https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%B3&from\\_source=webtop\\_search&spm\\_id\\_from=333.788](https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%B3&from_source=webtop_search&spm_id_from=333.788)\n\nAll the propaganda and fake news follows the same narrative, and all the trending videos and posts on popular social media sites reinforce that narrative. Meanwhile the Western media is oblivious and complacent to the stuff that CCP is spreading internally and externally (on YouTube in Chinese), which is the complete opposite to the innocence and neutrality act that Chinese diplomats plays on the international stage. Everyone is so afraid of being called a racist, but China doesn't have such worries. The CCP seems to be setting their people up for an ideological and civilizational confrontation with the West and with democracy. This war in Ukraine right now will look like a child's play when China is ready to flip the table and take on the rules based world order full on.",

It's been only three weeks since its first post, but the account today has about 300 posts and more than 60,000 followers. **It's also mentioned in Switzerland's paper of record Neue Zürcher Zeitung, and the Chinese versions of Voice of America and DW News.**\n\nThe Great Translation Movement is also drawing a different kind of attention — criticism from the Chinese establishment.\r  \n\r  \n**State-run media have called the tweets a \"smear campaign\" against the Chinese**, since the majority of the account's posts highlight inaccurate information, or China's Russian sympathies.\r  \n\r  \n\"What kind of people are behind the 'Great Translation Movement'? Why do they see only hatred and negative messages from Chinese internet in their eyes?\" China's state-run paper Global Times wrote last week. \r  \n\r  \nIn response, the anonymous owners of the account said they choose to publish the most popular or viral posts or comments to \"convey the thoughts of the Chinese masses as precisely as possible.\" \r  \n\r  \n**The rapid rise of The Great Translation Movement is indicative of Western appetite to understand China's biases through the accessible lens of social media posts.** Experts cautioned, however, against over-relying on online sentiment to indicate what a 1.4 billion-strong population thinks.  \n\"We do have an information gap between China and the West, and not many social media users in the West are able to dive into Weibo and grasp the Chinese online sentiments and expressions,\" said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State University who's fluent in Mandarin and Russian, of the account's popularity.  \nBut, she added, the account makes some of its own editorial decisions, \"picking very provocative posts, which are attention-grabbing.\"\n\nThe operators behind The Great Translation Movement declined to provide their identities to Insider, and have publicly remained anonymous."

Whether you agree with him or not, the real gist of Tucker Carlson’s argument has been that getting bogged down in a war with Russia when Ukraine has no strategic relevance to the US is a distraction (of course he is wrong about that and he’s too sympathetic towards Putin’s victim blaming tactics), but his point has been that the real threat is China - I bet CCTV didn’t mention that lol.\n\nA lot of people have been saying for a long time now that military attention needs to shift to China and away from Russia. This war massively helps China in as much as America was in the process of very publicly shifting its focus to China and away from Eastern Europe and now their focus is very publicly shifting back to Eastern Europe. I think what too many people are missing (both on the left and the right) is that this is a two headed beast and has been for some time now. The solution to this is that Europe starts pulling its own weight militarily. The UK for example now only has about 70,000 active soldiers in the army and they were due to make further cuts this year before all this kicked off. That’s not enough troops to retake and hold one major city let alone a country. It’s a joke. Europe needs to spend more on its own defence, be it collectively or at a state by state level. It has the wealth, man power and technological know how to put together a force that would collectively rival anyone but European politicians just don’t want to spend money on defence.",

            "text": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the biggest thing that happened in 2022. It was an invasion that violated international law. What's more important is that Russia has committed many war atrocities. At a time when progress in this war is still possible, I think it's highly understandable for many people to prefer an ending in which the bully is defeated. But I have a big worry, that is, I have also seen domestic support for Trump in the United States, and many sentiments that do not support continued assistance to Ukraine are also growing. Well, as a Chinese I think it's okay, just a foreign, and there is the one of the poorest places in Europe losing a small part of its own rule.\n\nBut what I am more worried about is: if Americans continue to consume their domestic enthusiasm for foreign things, what kind of help can China's democracy receive from the outside in further? You may not know that the CCP’s internal suppression is very surprising. Before the trade war, the United States almost condoned various unfair international trade competition behaviors of the CCP, and even condoned commercial and technical espionage. This is very strange,but there is obviously a reason, because China has long been the largest trading partner of the United States. Chinese workers can tolerate very low wages but produce a lot. Ukraine is not the most important thing in my life, but the long-term peace disaster caused by the CCP, including their internal suppression, unemployment rate, and poverty, are very serious. From a righteous point of view, letting the worst dictatorship on earth collapse is also more important than the territory of Ukraine (I saw a lot of people on reddit saying I was hypocritical for thinking so, and then they blocked me), if If the CCP invades Taiwan, the entire world will be affected far more than the war in Ukraine. The CCP is also facing significant economic pressure now, because reforms forced by external forces are possible. This is not the first time for the United States.\n\nI don’t want to be called a hypocrite on reddit just for saying a few words about human rights in my own country and my concerns about the domestic situation in the United States. This is very unreasonable.\n\nWhat do you think? r/China? Do you care about China's politics? In this sub, do you only care about the Chinese girlfriends you see in life or \"China's trade competitiveness with the United States is declining?\" so you will be optimism ?If you are Americans, would you rather continue to support the fight against CCP after the war in Ukraine is over(with the possibly recession) , just like you support Ukraine?\n\nThis is an honest question that troubles my conscience",

                "nonpaywall: merica has long believed that helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion was not only essential to preserving the security of Europe, but also important to deterring China from invading Taiwan. On July 28th it took that reasoning a leap forward by announcing it would for the first time start to arm Taiwan from America’s own military stocks, as it has done repeatedly for Ukraine. The main difference is that it has not invoked an “emergency” to justify the move. Instead, it believes the arms supplies will help forestall a war across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe military move may instead provoke a new crisis. China will not accept American claims that it is nothing out of the ordinary, and represents “no change” in America’s Taiwan policy. After all, America is shifting from selling weapons to Taiwan to subsidising its armed forces. Even before the announcement, a Chinese defence-ministry spokesman denounced arms supplies to Taiwan as “malicious acts”, saying they posed “a serious threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and created significant strategic risks in China-us military relations”.\n\nThe question is whether, as in the past, China will show its anger by stepping up its military harassment of Taiwan, such as its daily testing of Taiwanese defences by flying close to its airspace and sailing near its territorial waters. Last year China fired salvos of missiles close to the self-governing island following a high-profile visit by Nancy Pelosi, the then Speaker of America’s House of Representatives. America has repeatedly accused China of carrying out dangerous manoeuvres close to its ships and planes, raising the risk of collision and superpower escalation.\n\nThe White House offered few details of the arms, worth $345m, to be supplied through the fast-track “presidential drawdown authority” (pda). It said only that it would provide “defence articles and services” as well as “military education and training”. A Pentagon spokesman said the package would include unspecified anti-armour and anti-aircraft weapons, as well as “multi-domain awareness” (mq-9A surveillance drones, according to leaks). More such military aid may soon follow, given that Lloyd Austin, the defence secretary, has said he intends to use the full $1bn authorised by Congress before the current fiscal year ends on September 30th.\n\nThe attempt to play down the move—by burying the announcement in legalese and issuing it late on a Friday, classically a means of burying awkward news—betrays a certain trepidation in the administration of President Joe Biden. He faces at least three sets of conflicting pressures.\n\nFirst is the worry about provoking a new crisis with China, having sent a succession of senior officials to talk to their Chinese counterparts since May. They include Jake Sulivan, the national security adviser; Antony Blinken, the secretary of state; Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary; and John Kerry, the climate envoy. All, in their various ways, have sought to create a “floor” under Sino-American relations. But military-to-military communications are still all but non-existent. “The Department of Defence continues to seek open communication with Beijing,” the Pentagon said, adding that it would “continue to support Taiwan’s maintenance of a sufficient self-defence capability.”\n\nAgainst this effort is the countervailing pressure from Congress, especially Republicans, who accuse Mr Biden of being too soft on China and getting little in return for his diplomatic outreach. Indeed, some believe the president has delayed the Taiwan pda for fear of upsetting the Chinese—a claim that American officials vehemently reject.\n\nThird, Mr Biden must satisfy Ukraine’s pressing need for more weapons as its counter-offensive progresses slowly and its cities are repeatedly pounded by Russian missiles and drones. After a wave of attacks on Odessa, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, urged the world to create a “full-fledged sky shield” over Ukraine. “We need more air-defence systems for our entire territory, for all our cities and communities. The world must not get used to Russian terror,” he wrote in a Telegram post.\n\nThe Biden administration has hitherto claimed it could “walk and chew gum” at the same time: that is, help push back Russia’s onslaught while deterring China. Even as it has rallied European allies to help Ukraine defend itself, the administration has been weaving a variety of mini-alliances in the Indo-Pacific to constrain China. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin have been criss-crossing the Pacific this week to strengthen the geopolitical “latticework”. In Brisbane on July 29th they are expected to announce a further tightening of the military alliance with Australia, including the upgrading of military bases in the country, more deployments of American forces, deeper defence-industrial ties and greater military co-operation with other countries in the region.\n\nTypically military supplies for Ukraine have been donated from American stocks—this week it announced its 43rd PDA for Ukraine, worth $400m and bringing the total to $24bn—whereas Taiwan has bought its arms under the lengthier Foreign Military Sales system. The Pentagon says the Taiwan package will not affect supplies for Ukraine. Yet Ukraine and Taiwan are now competing for American donations and, in some cases, the same weapons, too. The backlog of Taiwanese orders, which stands at more than $14bn, includes contracts for the Javelin missile, used to stop tanks, and the Stinger, used to bring down aircraft. Large quantities of both have been supplied to Ukraine.\n\nIn contrast with the PDAs for Ukraine, Congress has not appropriated funds needed to replenish weapons being given to Taiwan. In the short term the Pentagon can probably re-allocate funds internally, say congressional staffers. But for the new Taiwan policy to be sustainable, Congress will have to appropriate money in the next fiscal year. That, in turn, will depend on the tortuous budgeting process in a divided Congress, especially the House, where “America First” admirers of Donald Trump, who are sceptical if not hostile towards Ukraine, hold greater sway.\n\nAssuming Congress can agree on a budget on time, Mr Biden will probably face demands for even stronger measures to help Taiwan, including grants to buy weapons and more intense training. After all, one of the few issues on which Mr Biden’s political supporters and foes can agree is the need to confront China. Some senior figures worry that such unanimity may prove an even greater danger than political dissension.",

                "Rough translation:\n\nBefore sleeping I want to say something that many people might not want to hear, but I personally think is the truth: I don’t know why so many people support Russia sending their military into Ukraine and make fun of Ukraine. As Chinese living in a country which has also been invaded by great powers in the past, everyone should understand the pain of being invaded by a vastly militarily superior country. In my opinion this is indeed an act of invasion; the reason for the attack is simple: because Ukraine was getting too close to countries Russia didn’t like, and considering joining their supranational organizations. Who knew that Ukraine is an independent, sovereign country (sarcasm)—who they’re close to, what organizations they join should be a right of sovereign independent countries. This is like our daily personal relationships: who someone is close to is one’s own choice, and you can’t just beat someone up for hanging out with someone you don’t like, could you justify that?\n\nIf we’re all cheering on Russia and supporting them now, what’s the difference between us and someone who supported the invasion of our country by Japan back then?\n\nI don’t know why I said all this, but I felt uneasy in my heart not saying it. Actually, often there are good fans that will tell me not to be so honest from time to time, go with the mainstream opinion, and follow the views of the majority of netizens—this way I can get a bigger audience. I also was determined to do this, but sometimes I really can’t resist but say some incriminating words.",

                "Ambivalent. \n\nOne of the defining traits of a successful totalitarian state is an ironclad stranglehold on its citizens' minds, to the point where 2+2=5. Yeah, yeah, Orwellian terminology is overused, but I never saw such clear examples of doublethink in real life before I began following Chinese affairs. It was pretty shocking. So yes, I would describe China as a totalitarian country, and yes, I subsequently expect the government to hold a tight grip on its citizens' minds. For us Westerners, the absurdity and oppression is obvious, but we're on the outside looking in. Totalitarian control is more than just the blunt force of a boot stomping on a face forever; it's far more insidious than that. True control is putting the boot in the mind, stomping down dissident thought patterns--not because you're afraid to think dissident thoughts, but because it literally doesn't occur to you. If you grew up believing the stories your native media tells, why would you suddenly switch to believing foreign media when it claims that your native news is lying and your government is committing terrible deeds? That's just one example, but you get the idea. \n\nBeyond that, I think there's some psychological incentive to believe what the government says. Who wants to believe that their country is committing atrocities? Hell, look at how many people in the US get their panties in a twist when folks say, \"Hey, maybe we should talk about *past* shittiness in America.\" And even if you do believe, what can you do? You'll get censored for just posting sympathy for Hong Kong, and much worse if, God forbid, you actually take action. So why bother? Besides, do you *really* want to disturb the government that has provided so much stability and prosperity? Do you *really* want to go back to the age of warlords? It's so much easier to just nod and smile. But nodding and smiling on the surface is a slippery slope to nodding and smiling in the soul.\n\nSo the government has a tight grip on people's minds, so tight that many don't even realize it. In that situation, it takes a severe shock to shake people out of complacency. And that's what we're seeing right now. Better late than never, right? At least people are waking up and realizing that the pot is boiling, *has* been boiling for years.\n\nBut on the flipside...complacency is consent. And a lot of Chinese are *more* than just complacent. Maybe not the majority, but certainly enough to extend the reach of the CCP into other countries. Many of the little pinks who harass non-Chinese netizens are living outside of China. You regularly get stories of bullying on *foreign* campuses, where Chinese students who don't toe the party line get attacked by other Chinese students...and God help you if you're a Uyghur kid. You know, there are plenty of other authoritarian states with censored media, shitty schools, etc., where people are canny enough to see though the lies their government tells. There are plenty of immigrants and students from dictatorial countries who are willing to listen to alternative views, even if they don't always agree with them. Why are Chinese citizens so different? In that context, this new awareness seems profoundly selfish, and I have to wonder how long it will last.\n\nSo I'm ambivalent. I understand how insidious state-sponsored brainwashing can be, and I'm glad to see people shaking it off. But I can't help but wonder how genuine this sentiment is. It depends on what happens in the future--will people hold onto this perspective after the quarantine lifts? Or will the horrors of Shanghai become another bizarre aberration to be memory-holed with a million other misdeeds?",

And Germany is still operating on this 1990’s early 2000’s mentality where China was a bastion, heading towards democratic reforms. They need to wake up and smell the strong coffee and see the two headed snake for what it really is. China is a staunch rival and seeking to monitor the world under their style of governance. I think they’ll eventually collapse from within before that ever happens. And their style wouldn’t even come close to flying in truly liberal societies.\n\nEdit: people have seen the game they’re playing.

                "lol the only way China will take Taiwan by force is via neutron bombs. \n\nRussia had years of battle-hardening its troops in Donbas and Syria and they are still hopeless in the face of a determined defender. Taiwan’s been preparing for invasion for 70 years.",

Stick to what you said and fight that war to the end. Every. Square. Centimeter. Back to the 1991 borders. It's not like Europeans in the EU are dying. Show China the might of your military industrial complex and send China trembling with fear. Fight that war to the last Ukrainian.

                "The cartoon doesn't make sense. I said it as a Vietnamese.\n\nAll catchment of the Mekong River in China only supplies 15% of the total discharge. Yes, China built large dams, but also Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. \n\nFurthermore, the idea that dams lead to droughts is false. Large dams might cause some reduction when they are filling up, but in the long run, they contribute to regulating water flows and mitigating the hazards of droughts and flooding (as they are designed to do). The largest impacts that dams have is on sediments and aquatic ecosystems, not water quantity. \n\nChina definitely needs to be transparent and cooperative in managing the Mekong River, though.\n\nPS: There have been multiple reports about the impacts of dams on Mekong river. Most have mentioned the undeniable effects of dams on silt and sediments, as well as on livelihoods of farming and fishery communities downstream. However, still little evidence is supporting the notion on the impacts of dams on water discharge. There are some reports from Eyes on Earth indicating that, but there are also counterargument. You can read this report from MRC about the 2018-2019 droughts (which also cites other reports from Eyes on Earth and Tsinghua Uni.)\nhttps://www.mrcmekong.org/assets/Publications/Mekong-low-flow-and-drought-conditions-2019-2021df.pdf",
