                "Well, while war is always hell and chaotic destruction, I got to say that I firmly back the stiff posture of the Ukraine here.   \n\nLet no one forget that it was Russia who illegally crossed the border with troops and took over possessing land that belonged to Ukraine, a sovereign Nation... a sovereign Democratic Nation at that.   \n\nHistory tries to repeat itself... so I draw eerie similarities with President Trump's.peave agreement overtures which basically stating and Pres. Trump trying to bully Ukraine into accepting some land lost...namely the lands Russia already has invaded and took control of.for the time being in the Donesk region.  That sounds eerily similar to the prime Minister who came before Winston Churchill, who came back with the \"Peace in our Time\" trendy slogan where the European nations basically signed over nearly all of Czechoslovakia and other areas taken control of by Hitler just prior to WW2 with the promise by Hitler that he wouldn't continue on his land grabs.  Turns out in history that Hitler didn't abide by his promise and he turned right around and just kept land grabbing by invasion.\n\n I see no reason why Putin wouldn't do the same thing other than the fact that Russia is getting their ass fucking handed to them by the Ukraine vis-a-vis donated NATO weapons.  While Ukraine forces are good, they were originally outmanned 64 to 1. \n\n Without the advanced weapon systems given to Ukraine by NATO, Russia would have boss hog smashed the Ukraine.  I am sure that pisses Putin off where he had dreams of the grand legacy of rebuilding the Soviet Empire. Yet, I think it's crazy to allow Russia any benefits here where they illegally invaded a sovereign democratic-values nation without cause or provocation simply because Ukraine voted in a leader that was not friendly to Putin or Russia.  Giving in and giving up the land grabs he has thus far would only serve to encourage other nations to do the same.  Such as China for instance who salivates waiting for a time to invade Taiwan.\n\nLet's be frank.... the situation is that we are a democratic nation as Ukraine is.  We're supposed to support our kindred spirits as such because we would want the same.  Taiwan and South Korea and Philippines and Japan are all watching closely how the USA handles this as it would be seen as representative of how we would support them in similar circumstances.  China is mindful that they too might be able to negotiate similarly by force invasion of Taiwan.  See, it is not so simple.  \n\nAs for the UK, bravo on the pledgr for troops, but supporting anything less than a full withdrawal by Russia is a sin and counter to both our nations' promise of liberty and opportunity in democratic ideals.  We would be hypocrits to back anything less than full withdrawal by Russia.  It is not okay to simply invade whoever you want when you want to get what you want.  \n\nThe Ukraine is completely against the proposed peace agreement and I don't blame them.  I think they should stand strong and stand firm. Russia should withdraw their forces back to their own border.  Humble pie though will be a nasty treat to eat for Russia though, but serves them right."

                ">Today, the world's leading democracies also agreed to an unprecedented step, convert the interest on $280 billion of frozen Russian assets currently held in Europe into a loan to help Ukraine buy weapons and repair nearly half-a-trillion dollars of damage.\n>\n>It's not the European taxpayers that are paying for the damage that Putin is causing with this war of aggression, but it is Putin.  It's not the European taxpayers that are paying for the damage that Putin is causing with this war of aggression, but it is Putin.\n>\n>So for the Europeans and the U.S. alone, the U.S. as well, they actually have — they're actually not going to be seizing Russian assets, per se. The $300 billion worth of assets, two-thirds of which are in Europe, a tiny portion of which were in the United States, what they're actually going to do is they're basically going to use the interest on those assets.\n>\n>So the $180 billion worth of Russian assets sitting in Europe obviously creates interest, and the smaller amount in the U.S. also has interest, much like a savings account. And what they're going to do is use that interest, not the principal, rather, but the interest, to collateralize a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n>\n>So it's not only removed from the perspective of the principal, so the underlying asset of Russia is not going to be touched, just the interest. But, on top of that, they're actually only going to sort of take that if — quote, unquote — \"the loan\" that they're giving to Ukraine is not repaid. So it's just collateral, essentially, rather than going after a direct seizing of Russian assets by either the Europeans or the Americans.\n\n\nI'm reading this as:  If Putin makes Ukraine incapable of repaying the interest loaned to Ukraine, Putin still loses it."

And if anyone on the planet used a nuke against anyone else, the entire world would attack them and grind them into the dirt. Posturing is what the Cold War was all about, and the same holds true today.",
                " \n\nAny Nuclear War better than WMD-proliferation started by destruction of International Law and proofs that now absolutely everything decided by \"WMD-Might make Right/True\" logic.\n\nIn the 1920s people also thought that there was nothing worse than WW1, but then have arrived 1940s.\n\nThe same and with WW3 and Nuclear War. It's really possible that there will come a time when people will dream that Nuclear War was saved at least some international rules.\n\nSomething similar and with the foundation of modern civilization. In theory, to save millions of lives, the West could to sell own values and principles. But with each such sale it would save not so much modern people but more and more bandits, fanatics, slave traders and cannibals. Bringing everyone back to times of zero value of human life."

                "The short answer is NATO weapons systems on Russia's border although they're claimed to be defensive, can be converted to be used offensively to drastically reduce Russia's ability for a second-strike response. Similarity can be drawn from the Cuban Missile Crisis. The longer answer is as follows.\n\nNATO was created strictly to counter the USSR. After the Soviet Union collapsed alongside the former Warsaw Pact, why did NATO not only continue to exist but grow in power to an unprecedented level? What did Russia do between 1991-2013 that was so egregious to European security interests?\n\nThe justification for NATO expansionism has been that Russia supposedly has aspirations for empire building.\nFor all the talk of Russian imperialism and that Putin wants to rebuild the Russian empire, all they've managed to do between 1991-2013 is quell an internal crisis in Chechnya and support separatists in Transnistria, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. That doesn't seem like serious empire building to me. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and starting supporting Donbass. More substantial actions, but not quite empire building. Now they've started a war in Ukraine, the most substantial move to date but not what I consider the beginning of building an empire, since they'll never be able to control the territory entirely.\n\nNATO needs Russia to be perceived as an enemy to validate it's existence. NATO needs Russia to be it's enemy, it's raison d'etre."

            "text": "Edit: it's \"message\", I've just mistyped lol\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not advocating anything in this post. I do not disseminate deliberately false information and do not betray my homeland. All I want is to speak up.  \n\nI am Russian, I am 21 y. o. and I am a student. When the problem with Ukraine started in 2013-2014, I was 13 y. o. I didn’t watch the news, as I wasn’t interested in it, and I didn’t understand anything about politics.  \n\nA lot has changed over the years, and so have I. When the war began on February 24, to be honest, I was not even surprised. This does not mean that I SUPPORT the war. On the contrary, I believe that every life is sacred. But I always knew that despite humanism and pacifism, wars have always been, are and will be. And we all have one end - death, merely someone will die earlier, and someone later. And this is a reality.  \n\nThe first thing I did was to read the news and follow the situation. But when I went to social networks, where I follow some Ukrainian bloggers, I felt absolutely uncomfortable. I faced the strongest psychological pressure when a person told me through the screen that it was ME who was to blame for what had happened, ant it is MY fault that I, like all Russians, was allegedly apolitical. Many Russians succumbed to this and began to apologize. But I don’t want to apologize. Because when I turned 18, I acquired the right to vote, which I have always used as intended. I am not apolitical, I am no longer 13 y. o. girl, and I did NOT make this decision.  \n\nDespite this unpleasant moment, I do not feel hatred for Ukrainians. I’m sorry this war happened. I know that civilians are dying, I know everything. I have no relatives in Ukraine, but I have friends and acquaintances for whom I worry. I even know a Ukrainian soldier who is now fighting against my country, but we do not hate each other.  \n\nYesterday I decided to look into the origins of the current situation and began to read about the Euromaidan. I am one of those people who is looking for cause and effect relationships. And I found the following:  \n\n- during the Euromaidan, which was originally a protest action of civilians for Ukraine to join the European Union, diverse nationalist groups (UNA-UNSO, “Trident”, “Patriot of Ukraine”, etc.) formed the right-wing extremist association “Right Sector”, considering the Euromaidan only as a convenient pretext for starting a “national revolution”, which, according to the leader of the “Right Sector” Dmytro Yarosh, was supposed to end with “the complete elimination of the regime of internal occupation and the creation of a Ukrainian national state with a system of all-encompassing national democracy”;  \n\n- Representatives of the parliamentary opposition said that the government intends to establish an authoritarian dictatorship in Ukraine, and demanded the convocation of the People’s Rada instead of the compromised Verkhovna Rada, the resignation of President Yanukovych and early presidential elections. In the following days, opposition-minded demonstrators in a number of regions of Ukraine proceeded to seize the buildings of regional state administrations. In western Ukraine, these actions were successful, while in the regions of central Ukraine, these attempts were suppressed by law enforcement agencies;  \n\n- On February 21, under pressure from Western countries, President Yanukovych made concessions and signed an agreement with the opposition to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, which included, in particular, an immediate return to the Constitution as amended in 2004, the formation of a government of national unity, holding early presidential elections no later than December 2014 year, non-use of violence and investigation of recent acts of violence. On the same day, Yanukovych left Kyiv;  \n\nI would like to note that very little is written in the foreign media about the role of radical right parties in this event.  \n\n- Right Sector’s political ideology has been described as hardline right-wing nationalist, neo-fascist, or neo-Nazi, and right-wing, far-right or radical right. Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in Russian media during the first half of 2014, and Russian state TV depicted it as neo-Nazi because of its far-right, extremist views and anti-Russian sentiment; the Associated Press found no evidence that the group had committed hate crimes. According to the UN Human Rights Council, Right Sector is one of “potentially violent militias that acted seemingly on their own authority, thanks to a high level of official tolerance, and with almost complete impunity, both in the Donbass region and in wider Ukraine” that “use violence or threats of violence to exert pressure on persons holding dissenting views, the judicial system and other mechanisms of accountability”.  \n\n- The other main far-right party Right Sector won 1 seat (of the 450 seats in the Ukrainian parliament) in the same 2014 election.  \n\nMy question is: how can a radical right party, which even the Foreign media consider as neo-fascist one, be tolerant of other nations, and how can one say that the Russian media exaggerates everything? Meanwhile, the same foreign media are writing the following:  \n\n- In the wake of the 2014 Euromaidan, Eduard Dolinsky, executive director of the Kyiv-based Ukrainian Jewish Committee, expressed concern over the rise of antisemitism in Ukraine in an opinion for the New York Times, citing the social acceptance of previously marginal far- right groups and the government’s policy of historical negationism with regard to antisemitic views of, and collaboration in the Holocaust by Ukrainian nationalists. Dolinsky also pointed out that Ukrainian Jews overwhelmingly supported and often participated in the Euromaidan protests.  \n\nHere are my favorite discoveries:  \n\n- American economist and political commentator Paul Roberts said that everything that happens in Ukraine was financed by the United States. He also noted: “This does not mean that the Ukrainians have no real justified claims. However, it is clear that all this is planned for Ukraine to join the EU and NATO in the future. Because the main goal of the United States is to locate its own military bases on its territory, next to the Russian border. On December 13, 2013, US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated during the Ukraine-USA Foundation conference that the United States has supported the building of democracy in Ukraine since its independence in 1991, and also called on the government, the president and the Ukrainian people to heed the voice of Euromaidan. The speech said that $5 billion had been spent on building democracy and other goals.  \n\n- US President Barack Obama on February 1, 2015, said in an interview with CNN that “we mediated the transition of power in Ukraine.”  \n\nThis is not propaganda. These are confirmed official facts that can be found on the Internet with all the necessary links.  \n\nWhile I was looking for information in every language available to me, I noticed the following: foreign media are actively putting Russia in a bad position. Both in English and in Ukrainian Wikipedia they write that it was Russia that sponsored the Anti-Maidan movement. Perhaps this is true, I do not know. Meanwhile, the Russian Wikipedia writes, as you have already noticed, that the radical right movements and the Euromaidan were funded by the USA.  \n\nBased on these mutual accusations, we can draw the following conclusion: the war is not between Russia and Ukraine, but between Russia and the USA (aka NATO). And, as Paul Roberts pointed out, the problem is that US-led NATO is trying to contain Russia by building military bases in neighboring countries. Then it turns out that Russia really does not benefit from Ukraine’s accession to the European Union, but also everyone knows that for the same reason Russia does not return the Kuril Islands to Japan.  \n\nBy encircling Russia, NATO will be able to rule my country. Perhaps we will be forced to sell oil, gas and other resources for next to nothing. They might force us to do something else. But if Russia will try to get out of this control, “our temple will already have the barrel of a gun next to it.”  \n\nI don’t know if our government made the right decision by starting this war. I don’t like either the war or the prospect of becoming dependent on NATO. But as it seemed to me, from the point of view of politics, the question has no long been between war and peace. The question that confronts us is like the trolley problem. And perhaps our government has to choose the lesser of two evils.  \n\nRegarding the attitude of the Russians:  \n\nThere are idiots everywhere, that’s a fact. From my observation, a lot of people in Russia are worried about the Ukrainians. The problem is that any attempts to express the opinion against the decision taken by the Russian government are suppressed. Yesterday I was walking along Nevsky Prospekt, and there was a huge number of police cars, ready to catch the protesters. Posts on the Internet are considered treason. Students at my university are being expelled for taking part in demonstrations. The media of all countries lie, and the Ukrainians in the comments psychologically put pressure on the Russians, asking to participate in demonstrations even at the cost of our own lives.  \n\nI am writing this post with fear that the government of my own country will consider me a traitor. But my desire to convey this information is too strong, because, being Russian, I am tired of hearing from everywhere year after year that Russians are a terrible nation. Please, stop blaming the Russians for everything, our opinion wasn’t asked when this decision was made.  \n\nMy grandfather was a child during World War II. His village was occupied by the Nazis. In front of his eyes, his older brother was blown up on a mine. My grandfather himself once stumbled upon a mine and his finger was torn off. He saw shelling, explosions and enemy planes. He was on the verge of life and death. But he never hated the Germans. Because German soldiers fed him and other Russian children with a food and German chocolate, which was hard to come by even in the 80s.  \n\nAs for myself, I do not hate Ukrainians, and I hope for the same in return. No war is a reason to hate each other. Hatred breeds another hatred, and once this cycle begins, it will never end.  \n\nI have a right to tell this because I know what it’s like to lose relatives. I saw my grandmother’s face when my uncle died. He was a military man, he was killed by other soldiers during the audit, because he did his job too responsibly. I saw my grandmother’s eyes, I saw her go crazy, I saw her give up. She died.  \n\nPlease don’t give up no matter what. Stay safe and don’t give in to the lowest feelings. If you give up, you lose. To lose means to die.",

                "The two things that the vast majority of Russians have yet to understand are:\n\n1) The Russian government has been lying and exaggerating the right-wing fascist role in Euromaidan and the subsequent Ukrainian government for 8 years. Originally, because that narrative justified in moral terms the annexation of Crimea and then the continuation of a frozen conflict in Donbas. Never were the majority of Ukrainians, the majority of Ukrainian voters, the majority of Ukrainian armed volunteers, the majority of Ukrainian politicians, the majority of the Ukrainian military right-wing fascists and/or nazis. Never did the Ukrainian right-wing hold enough power to greatly influence nationally policy and they certainly have failed to maintain any staying power. They were covered by the US media, and widely on the internet, in great part for the sensationalist aspect - Russian media domestically amplified the sensationalism to absolutely absurd heights because Russia's economy tanked and stagnated after 2014 and Ukrainian fascists provided a nice distraction from the extent to which Russia's economy stumbled as well as a rallying cry to unite at least enough Russians behind Putin.\n\n2) The United States did not, despite whatever Obama claims (let's remember Syria at this exact same moment in time was an absolute foreign policy debacle for him) and whatever Paul Robertson (a long retired Reagan-era functionary) claims. Victoria Nuland was a red herring (a metaphor for a distraction), as was all that the Russians \"uncovered\" that America was doing in Ukraine. The US was not committed to resolving the frozen conflict in the Donbas until suddenly it became a hot conflict two weeks ago. NATO was basically disintegrating because it had no purpose... until two weeks ago. Narratives about NATO as a unified entity, as a diabolical platform for the destruction of Russia, are just absolutely so absurd to people who study international security from around the rest of the world that Russia and it's foreign policy statements make it a laughing stock simply because all those claims are bullshit. Just like the absurdity of Russia's launch and catastrophic execution of this war so far only reinforces the idea abroad that Russia's strength is spent, that it is a state drowned in its own fantastical propaganda about its own glory and self righteousness. Putin's fumbling of this whole affair has proven that the Russian government, military, economic integrity, and national politics make it at best a second rate regional power that just so happens to have inherited nuclear weapons. Russia has no steadfast friends, no steadfast economic base, no steadfast moral compass and therefore will take years if not decades to even begin repairing its image save for a dramatic change in government (which the US will no orchestrate because the US most of all doesn't want thermonuclear war). NATO - and the vast majority of its members - had no interest in Russia up until about February 24, 2022, and the majority of states in it would have been just as happy without the alliance because NATO was a stumbling block to European economic integration rather than - as Russians claim - the diabolical end point of EU integration. Everything Russians \"know\" about NATO and world politics are solidly based on disinformation, targeted propaganda, and straight up Russian state media lies. Russians view NATO as a foil to the Warsaw Pact - but that's only because they realize the Warsaw Pact was a method of dominating the Eastern Bloc, which was never NATOs purpose in the West. After all, how many NATO member countries did the US invade and how many Warsaw Pact countries did the USSR invade - let's not forget that France even left NATO developed its own nukes, and only ever returned after demanding that it have to make no changes to its own command structure... essentially crippling NATO unity of command for a decade or more. Moreover, nobody wants to destroy Russia. The vast majority of Americans couldn't point to Russia on a map. Americans don't care or think about Russia nearly as much as Russians think about America, and maybe that's quite telling of the old Soviet trick, \"Повторять пока не поверят, и потом повторять еще сто раз на всякий случай.\"",
                "There was this agreement called the Budapest agreement where Ukraine gave up all their nukes for security by Russia, US, and UK not to invade Ukraine in the 1990s. In 2014 Putin invaded Crimea…a Ukrainian territory. Whether most spoke Russian there or not that violated that agreement. It’d be like Mexico invading California or the southwest because two hundred years ago it was their territory and a lot of people speak Spanish in the area. Doesn’t make it right. Everyday Russians, Ukrainians, or Americans don’t want war. We all want to live in peace and raise our families. Sometimes though a leader with too much power oversteps that peace. That’s what’s the issue, not everyday people.",

What are the values that are important to you?

                "With the development of better gas and oil extraction methods, like fracking, USA became a gas and oil exporter. Since the demand in the world is stable (main consumers have shrinking population), USA invested into installation of puppet regime on Ukraine, which controls Russian gas export to Europe, and tries to ban Nord Stream bypass of Ukraine, since they can't fairly compete with cheaper and more stable pipelined gas. Intention is to overtake over all Russian sales to Europe (which is a pretty juicy market).\n\nIf Russia wanted to invade Ukraine we would've done it in 2014 by supporting the legal president (which fled to Russia). Thing is, Ukraine was the most corrupt part of the USSR, and you know how the USSR ended. Over 30 years it demonstrated the worst economical growth on the planet. The world was fine with, for example,  Baltic states seceding from the USSR. Or Ukraine itself. Regions of Ukraine are trying to leave the state which is worse than USSR was.\n\nRussia spent billions to not deal with Ukraine (Nord Stream 2).",

To begin with, the period of Kievan Rus in no way refers to Ukraine except for their current capital and the tribes living on the territory of the current central Ukraina. Kievan Rus began with Novgorod.  \nLater, the territory of Ukraine and Belarus came under the influence of Lithuania/Poland, which of course split the people who lived in these territories into two camps. By this time, the territories of the Kherson Mykolaiv Donetsk, Lugansk and Odessa regions were not inhabited. These were the bare stipi where the nomadic tribes of Tatars lived. Peasants and bandits rushed there first, both from the territory of the Russian Kingdom and from the territory of Ukraine and became Cossacks there. Russia sought to return the former territories of Ancient Russia and all those who lived there were considered Slavs/Russians with some differences in culture and language. Such differences existed in many areas of the Russian Kingdom. Moscow, as the center of the new Slavic state, imposed both its own rules and the usual dialect. For example, I can understand 70-80 percent of Ukrainian speech, so this is a dialect of the language, and not a full-fledged language. You don't call American or Australian English a full-fledged language, do you? So we don't think so either.  \nIt is difficult to say about the history of Ukraine, for a while it was united with Poland, but then merged with the history of Russia. People from the territory of Ukraine fought together with the Russians in all wars, they made scientific discoveries, wrote poetry, but then they considered themselves citizens of another country and did not divide each other into nations."

                "So, first of all, remember that there are millions of native Russian speakers in Ukraine. And they are somewhat concentrated towards the east and south of the country. There are cities and towns where you can have 90% or 99% of Russian speakers (the numbers shifted post-2014 because it became \"fashionable\" to speak Ukrainian, but Russian is still extremely widespread).\n\nThat said, for example, all formal communication, even on the regional level, must be conducted in Ukrainian. If you're writing a request to your town council or a complaint to the police, or if a doctor is giving you a prescription, it must be in Ukrainian only. Speaking of doctors, the instructions for drugs are usually in Ukrainian only, and for older generations (who need them the most) it can be a serious problem. All movies in cinemas and most TV have to be dubbed into Ukrainian only. In the few largest cities you can have a chance of catching a movie in its original English (with Ukrainian subtitles), but pretty much everywhere else it's Ukrainian dub only. Education is conducted in Ukrainian only (at least officially, although some teachers, with the students' consent, continue to do so in Russian, but that's illegal). There are strict limits on how little non-Ukrainian content you're allowed to show on TV or play on a radio (so, for example, creating a Russian-language TV channel or a radio station that plays exclusively Russian music is illegal). Street signs, only in Ukrainian.\n\nI was finishing my master's degree in 2013, before the conflict and under the allegedly pro-Russian president in the city with nearly 100% of Russian speakers (Donetsk). I was told that my master's thesis could be in any language I wanted except for Russian. I asked, could I do it in English or French? They said yes. How about Chinese? Okay, if you manage to do that. Could I do it in... Swahili? You can try, they said. But not in Russian. They told me, speaking Russian. Not because it was some petty power trip, but for legal reasons.\n\nSo yeah. You're saying you're from Canada, so you must understand the concept of bilingualism. Imagine what would happen if French would be removed from all official capacities in Canada? If it now had all the same rights as Russian or Chinese in your country? Would people be happy about it?\n\nYou can *speak* Russian in Ukraine, but there's a lot of places where you're not allowed to *use* it.",

Economics is the root of everything.  \n\nAfter World War II, the United States built an international trading system based on the dollar.  The Breton-Woods system was even honest at first.  the dollar was backed by gold and it seemed to everyone that it was reliable.  but in 1965, French President de Gaulle demanded that the United States exchange dollars for gold.  It was removed very quickly and soon after that the US announced that the dollar was no longer backed by gold.  in fact, now it is not provided with anything, it's just air.  everyone who does not agree with this, the United States is trying to destroy by military means.  for example, Gaddafi was definitely a terrorist, he blew up planes and nightclubs, but in addition, for example, he promoted projects to supply Africa with water and others.  But when Gaddafi announced the rejection of the dollar and plans to create a \"golden dinar\", he was immediately destroyed.  Now China is interested in destroying the dollar.  However, the US is destroying it with its own hands.  freezing Russia's assets showed all countries that keeping assets in the US is a very bad idea.  Sanctions against Russia could destroy Europe's economy.  Russia China India and some other countries have agreed to create their own payment system based on national currencies.  if China takes control of Taiwan, it will deal a very severe blow to the US economy.  in general, everything looks like everything is just beginning .."

This is neither bad nor good, but from this story it is worthwhile to adequately understand and evaluate oneself in the world and the world around Ukraine.",
                "The Ukraine had several short lived independent states during Russian Civil War. However, most people either don't know about them or don't think they were important or sovereign enough.     \nYes, Ukraine as an independent state appeared in 1991.",
                "It has the same claim to statehood as Pskov, Burgundy, Brittany, or Bavaria.\n\nAnd yes, it is factually correct that it had never existed as a state in its modern borders before 1991.",
                "It's pretty weird to assume Ukraine is not a country now, but regarding the second statement - it's just a lack of general knowledge. There were too many short lived states, republucs, territories dusputed with Poland or Lituania, and whoever else in the course of history. After all there were union republics *before* they merged into USSR. We might relate them to modern states... or not. No one can wake Bogdan Khmelnitsky and ask his opinion on either modern Ukraine is related to his land or not. Their succession is based only on modern claims. (Obviously Russian schools now don't have textbooks exclusive to history of now foreign states unless it's global history course where short lived entities at the territory of modern Ukraine are just not relevant)\n\nWell people often confuse political, ethnical, historiographic and identity aspects of nations and nationalties. Ukrainian politics squeeze whatever they can from the timeline to build up their identity concept, people too, but we're just not so interested in tales of old times, especially if they're about something now irrelevant. From Russian perspective it's often like Rurikid Rus' then Russian tsardom and empire then USSR, then it breaks apart. Ukraine in all that is just oddly specific, they're not the only national republic and former SSR in the book.",

                "Since ethnically Russians and Ukrainians are so very close, you can't really tell them apart without them actually saying out loud which group they consider themselves to be a part of. Therefore it'd be really hard to do any kind of \"ethnic cleansing\" if they tried. Language is a bit easier, but even now Russian is a very commonly spoken language all over Ukraine, not just the east. Just ten years ago Gallup (an American polling agency) conducted a survey all over Ukraine regarding language. They gave the respondents a choice whether they preferred to take the survey in Russian or in Ukrainian, and over 80% chose Russian. While the Russian language was lacking any official rights before, it was only in 2014 that the new Ukrainian government started a concentrated push towards eradicating it from everyday speech (and even then it's a pretty slow one).\n\nSo as a result we have a situation that is more or less purely political. Being Ukrainian, for the more radically minded, simply means hating Russia and being loyal to the Ukrainian government. And if there is any kind of repressive action, it will be towards people who don't feel that.\n\nMyself, I am from Donetsk, that part of eastern Ukraine that declared independence and is right now not governed by Kiev. What people here are worried about is a military invasion by Ukraine in an attempt to take the territory back by force. If that happens (and that would only happen with the support of NATO), that's when things are likely to get really ugly. If you read Ukrainian press, listen to the government or gods forbid browse the social networks, you'll know that there are only two types of people living in these territories: innocent victims of the evil occupation and enemies of the state that must be eradicated. And seeing how it's the Ukrainian army that has been shooting at us for the past seven years, there aren't that many people over here that will come out to meet them with flags and flowers. There are some, sure, but not many.",
                "> Has that actually happened in Ukraine?   \n\n\nNot yet. But if we consider the entire war against Donbass which is being conducted for 7 years already as based on ethnic and (which is more important) ideological difference - then yes, it is happening right now.  \n\n\n> Is there lots of discrimination against ethnic Russians or Russian speakers in Ukraine?   \n\n\nOn the state level.  \n\n\nThe funniest thing that the people who issue the antirussian laws and oppress rights of russian-speaking ukrainians - speak russian at home. (Poroshenko and Zelensky for example)  \nI'm not joking.\n\n> I understand that a conflict like this can bring lots of xenophobia to the surface and make people suspicious of entire ethnic groups.   \n\n\nMost of xenophobia is being fueled through media.  \n\n\n> The US government had a racist policy of interning Japanese Americans because of they feared they were sympathetic to Japan.   Is the same attitude present in Ukraine? \n\nKind of. But the difference is that in USA it was linked with racism and here we are basically the same people.   \n\n\n>Is there a fear among some people in Ukraine that Russian speakers have a dual loyalty? \n\nThe key word \"among some people\" - these \"some people\" are about 3-5% of entire population.  \nConsidering that they speak russian themselves - they should not trust themselves either.",
                "There are ultranationalists in Ukraine who are an aggressive minority. They have no political representation in parliament or in government but they have unproportious power in the country. Their voice is the main in modern Ukraine’s pro-war politics",
                "Okaaay, so the thing is. Ukrainians would have a very hard time cleansing the country from Russian speakers because... they'll have to cleanse too many people. Possibly half of the country. That'd be stupid since many Ukrainian patriots don't speak Ukrainian. If you need a something to compare it to, think of the Irish who don't speak Irish but still hate England.\n\nMore likely Ukraine wants to assimilate Russian speakers into their culture and make them study their language. Which as insane as, for example, making Belgium a French ethnostate.\n\nThe reason why atrocities happen is mostly because Ukrainians bring radicals and ultra nationalists into the fight. Those that are called 'special volunteer detachments'.\n\nThey are a minority of course, but a very passionate one. As for bombing civilians, as bad as it may sound it's still the standard of warfare. It's a genuine disregard for human life, nothing to be surprised of.",

                "While discussing this topic it is important to take into consideration that half of modern Ukraine was “wild field” till the end of 18 century. Controlled by Ottoman Empire and it’s Crimean Khanate vassals it was sparsely populated before Catherine the Great started colonisation (think about from where settlers came). Drawing divisions between Russians and Ukrainians is a tricky thing, where person’s self perception is decisive, but it is and was changed by those who are in power. While Ukraine was a part of Poland upper class and urban Ukrainians polonised and their descendants considered themselves Poles and in Russian Empire the same process happened in direction of integration into unified All-Russian nation. Two ideas developed: Little-Russianness (Ukrainians are part of All-Russian nation together with Great Russians and Byelorussians) and Ukrainness (Ukrainians are separate and should distance from Russia). The first one of course was supported by imperial government and was popular in cities and among upper class, the second was spread by a group of intellectuals with support from Austro-Hungary (who feared that Russia will take it’s Slavic lands) and Britain (dead enemy of Russia), somewhat popular in rural areas of Western Ukraine. We should take into account that most people were peasants, who may be considered a part of any “nation” with clauses, as “nation” is a product of modernity and requires literacy, interconnected economic and social field on large territory, common national myths etc. Russian Empire would have turned peasant masses of what is now called Ukraine into Russians, but bolsheviks - russophobes in the first place and proponents of “cancel Russia”/affirmative action to minorities promoted creation of separate nation out of those peasants."

Русский (Nationality; Pronounced \"Ruskiy\"), Россиянин (Citizen of Russian Federation; pronounced \"Rosiyanin\"), Россия (Country; pronounced Rosiya), Русские (Ethnicity of our Slavic group; pronounced Ruskie) Россияне( Multiple amount of citizens of the Russian Federation; pronounced Rosiyane).\n\nAs we see in English you can't define what are you speaking of when saying\" Russian\" without explanation and the context. The trouble is our language is built in a way, where you can use such words without the context, when you use them as a single-word answer. It's absolutely understandable in Russian language but cuz there's no context and the word keeps the same form in English it's absolutely non understandable without the context in English.\n\nExamples with translation.\n\nWhat country are you from?- Russia\nИз какой ты страны?- Россия\n\nWhat language do you speak?- Russian\nНа каком языке ты говоришь?- На Русском.\n\nCitizenship of what country you have?- I'm Russian.\nГражданином какой страны ты являешься? - Я Россиянин \n\nWhat's you nationality?- I'm Russian\nКакая твоя национальность? - Я Русский \n\nAs you can see in last two, in English it's the same word for Nationality and Country, while in Russian language there's difference.\n\nI can presume that dumb people from both sides can mess up with this.And sometimes misunderstand if the other is speaking about being proud of his nationality or citizenship for example.

So the well being and security of all of them is the interest of Russia. Also Russia wants no heavy weapons on it´s border especially in combination with a Nato membership of Ukraine.\n\nOn the other hand Ukraine wants to regain controll of their territory that is currently under the controll of the locals supported by Russia. Also a big reason for this is that the Ukraine doesn´t want to give up the natural ressources and industrial assets in this regions.\n\nMy suggestion would be to setup a demilitarized zone of a certain size around and including this regions that will be monitored by a third party that has no interests in all of this. Russia and Ukraine are allowed to send monitoring partys with this third party to ensure that all terms are kept and nobody breaks the agreement. The politcal controll will be handed back to Ukraine to reinstate it´s territorial sovereignity but police and military controll will be handled by the third party.\n\nSo what do you think of this example? You can add your thoughts to it or suggest corrections where you think I´ve got the situation wrong.\n\nAlso if you have your own ideas that haven´t been brought up by the political leaders feel free to bring them up here.",

                "So it all comes down to EU funded and organised rebellion in 2014 that fucked country over. It drove the president at the time to flee in Russia and opened an question of legitimacy of Ukraine as a country. Russia tried to inspire pro Russian sentiment among those that weren't fine with coup taking over the country and new Ukrainian government responded by bloody cleansings of opposition while focusing neo-nazi groups to be the ones committing the massacres, though Ukrainian military commited a few itself. Those actions led to the Crimea claiming independance from Ukraine and then rejoining Russia. It also inspired rebellion in Donbass region where militia armed themselves and dug up against Ukrainian forces.\n\nWhat is widely ignored is that DPR (Donbass Peoples Republic) and LPR (Luhansk Peoples Republic) immediately pled for Russia to accept them into it too like it did with Crimea.. And Russia said: nah, I'm good.\n\nSo what's followed was factually an Ukrainian civil war (with Ukrainian neonazis properly accepted into Ukrainian military and Ukrainian president Poroshenko claiming Eastern Ukrainians to be demihumans not deserving treatment that \"proper\" Ukrainians receive) that longed for 7,5 years before Russia suddenly pretended that it only now heard DPR/LPR pleads.\n\nNow, to be honest, Russia did try to solve that conflict by negotiations and diplomatic means. That would look good for Putin globe-wide, after all. The Minsc agreements were made so that Ukraine goes through process of federalisation (not so different from Russian one after its own civil war in Chechnya) so that Donbass can be slowly reintegrated in Ukraine. Zelensky was elected as a president of peace to go through with that agreement.. Which he didn't and Ukrainian army kept shelling Donbass under him until Russia finally made a military move of saving Donbass people.\n\nTo be absolutely honest, saving is somewhat hypocritical cause Russia made it impossibly hard for people of Donbass to flee from the civil war into Russia, practically forcing them into no step back possible situation. It did help financially and possibly supplied some weapons and allowed volunteers in, though. Still, Ukraine's fascistic regime openly employs neonazis in their military, worship ss heroes of ww2 and were indeed shelling their own civilians so they are absolutely bad guys.",

                "The short version is: The majority of them, like most people, didn't really bother with \"identifying\" who they are. That was the realm of the intelligentsia, which had divided into two camps - those who identified as the Maloross, and those who identified as Ukrainians. The population *did* speak a language different enough from Russian, at least in the rural regions, but the ideas of nationalism were introduced to most of them, much as in the rest of Russia, in the process of getting them to support a cause for war.\n\nThe longer version requires a fair bit of explanation.\n\nAt the time, \"Malorossiya\" was the administrative boundary within the empire. \"Ukraine\" was a geographic term of a slightly larger area, similar to \"Siberia\". Both were often used interchangeably, though the former was preferred when talking about cultural matters.\n\nThe census used the term \"Maloross\" or sometimes \"Malorus\" for the cultural group, which was defined by the language used, and was depicted as being one of three parts of the larger \"Russian\" identity, alongside \"Belarus\" and \"Velikorus\" (\"Great Russian\").\n\nAs a result, within the Russian Empire, most, though not all, of the established intelligentsia that spoke the Maloross language did identify themselves as Maloross. This identity relied on the common cultural and historical ties of the Eastern Slavs going back to ancient Rus', the similarities in language which sometimes seemed as mere dialects of the greater whole, as well as on the Orthodox Christianity as the central pillar of Russian identity - at some periods of Russian history to be Orthodox was to be Russian. \n\nThe competing idea of a culturally and politically separate \"Ukrainian\" identity originated in Galicia, then part of the Austrian Empire. The Austrians themselves called the population there \"West Russians\". This idea did, however, spread through the intelligentsia in Russia as well, even a good while before WWI (when Austria encouraged it through propaganda to rile the locals against the government). It pointed to the difference in language, a distinct literary legacy, and to Ukraine's separate history - that of the Hetmanate. \n\nThe specifics are quite complicated, but in short - between the 15th and 17th centuries, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth claimed lordship over pretty much all land west of the Don river, but large parts of it were instead controlled autonomously and often in opposition to the Polish rule by the Cossacks, a military elite, who elected their ruler, called Hetman. They were in constant state of warfare against both the Polish and the Tatars from the south and the east. At times some of them allied with Moscow, at others, with Poland, which once even had a project for an autonomous \"Great Russian Principality\", ruled by the Hetman. \n\nThe Hetmanate was not exactly a state. It was a military structure first and foremost, meant to protect against the Tatar raiders and the Polish overlordship. There was no internal policy as such, no bureaucracy, barely even a system of taxes. It was a collection of warlords - hence their common title, \"воевода\". \n\nBut the political barriers between Russia and, as this region was known in the wider world at the time, Ruthenia, did lead to a divergence of culture and language. When these lands were brought under Russian control in the late 17th and over the 18th centuries, the political barriers went away, but the cultural ones didn't. The local population spoke a language similar, but recognizably different from that of the lands to the north. Still, the Austrian and Polish examples show that the population there was still considered Russian, at least by the Austrians and the Poles. And despite the Poles' best efforts, they were Orthodox, not Catholic.\n\nFor a long time, none of it really mattered. These lands, plagued as they were by constant warfare and slaver raids, didn't develop the same way greater Russia or Poland did. They had few cities, especially east of the Dnieper, and the main trade was grain and livestock. The questions of nationality didn't bother anyone but a tiny minority of politically active elite, most of whom were military leaders, and those of them that aligned against Russia were eliminated over the course of wars with Poland and Sweden. \n\nBut by the late 19th century, while the cities were primarily Russian - many of them across Novorossiya and the Don region having been founded under Russian rule, - the rural areas around the cities spoke a different language. And as literacy all across Russia increased, and ideas of nationality began to appear, the question of course arose - wouldn't the difference in language imply that this group of people isn't the same as that other one? Especially since there is a distinct historical and literary legacy present?\n\nThe Russian government disliked these ideas, because they reminded it of Polish attempts at regaining independence, and they undermined the stability of the sate. So, perhaps somewhat foolishly, there was initially a lot of pushback against this cultural identity, at times denying its existence in the first place. As it often happens, the harder you try to contain something, the worse it gets, so rather than solving the issue of separatism, it exacerbated it, pushing many of the cultural and political figures of Maloross origin to the Ukrainian idea. And while by the early 20th century this was mostly relaxed, with the term Maloross officially entered into the census, the effect was already there, and a substantial part of the Maloross intelligentsia, though by far not all of them, were antagonistic to the government. This was only made worse by the generally tense situation all across Russia in the early 20th century, where any cause, even one not relation to nationality, proved inflammatory, with the potential to spark a revolution.\n\nAfter that spark went off thrice and eventually started a civil war, nationality proved to be a major factor - not only were there full scaled attempts at creating a separate state, even if their rulers weren't popular at all, the whole thing was encouraged by the Bolsheviks. They used this narrative against the White movement, and pushed for their idea of internationalism. But because there was no prior Ukrainian nation before, they needed one - hence their creation of the Ukrainian SSR, their subsequent policy of \"nativization\", which saw the term \"Maloross\" eradicated while the Soviet government forced people to learn the Ukrainian language. And then there are Stalin's writings on how the Russian cities such as Kiev must and will become more Ukrainian, partially through the influx of the rural population, and partially through the eradication of what the Bolsheviks saw as the imperialist element of Russianness.",
                "In Russian Empire they considered Russians lived in Malorossian governorate. After the October revolution they become Ukrainians.\n\nSmall history of Malorossia\n\n1. Constantinople Patriarchy created two Metropolies - Metropoly of Galicia (Principality of Galicia–Volhynia and Principality of Turov and Pinsk) and Metropoly of Kiev (rest Russian lands). 1st one they named Micra Russia (small Russia, Malorossia) and 2nd Megale Rossia (great Russia, Velikorossia).\n2. After Poland had conquered  Principality of Galicia–Volhynia and later most territory of modern Ukraine and Belarus they called that land Malorossia (including Kiev which was Great Rossia). And later part of it began to be called Belorussia (white Russia).\n3. After Russian Empire conquered Poland they created Malorossian Governorate.\n4. After revolution this lands become Ukraine and Malorossia starts to consider offensive.\n\nMicra and Megale is analog of small Greece (Greece mainland) and big Greece (all Greece colonies).

                "At the beginning of the twentieth century, the process of acquiring national identity was still in development and remained the lot of narrow circles of urban intellectuals, while the majority of the population was an illiterate peasantry who did not delve into such issues of broader matter. For them, the main identity was Orthodoxy. Only with the advent of Soviet power and the subsequent increase in the level of universal literacy and prosperity, as well as the process of indigenization and familiarization of all peoples of the country with the riches of their national cultures, did national self-identity become a real thing.",

If the sanctions hold out, I don't think Russians are gonna be surviving potatoes and milk or anything, but there's a high chance it will impact the economy quite severely.\n\nThoughts?

Zelensky, for example, closed 7 TV channels that dared to only slightly criticize the authorities. He also put his pro-Russian opposition leader under house arrest and seized all his property.\r  \nThe Ukrainian government has been building up its army for 8 years, preparing to attack the seceded territories of Luhansk and Donetsk that disagree with it, killing 14,000 people during this time, most of whom were Russians. And she said that she also wanted to attack Russia and separate the Kuban from her. Also, recently on Ukrainian TV channels it was said that Ukraine wants to create nuclear weapons, and Zelensky openly said that he wants to denounce the memorandum that did not give Ukraine the opportunity to produce nuclear weapons and missile systems.\r  \nThe Russian army recently uncovered 30 biolabs during an operation, along with documentation that indicated that the US was working on military bioweapons programs in those labs.\r  \nAll this poses a terrible threat to Russia. Russia must clear Ukraine of the Nazis for its own security and prevent the West from creating an anti-Russian foothold in this territory."

You are a combatant that is legally protected by treaties and conventions regulating treatment of opponents and POWs( like the famous Geneva Conventions), which are in theory followed so that the opposing side will also follow them in turn.\n\n2) you are a civilian. Stay low, and it's also super prohibited for anyone to directly or indirectly harm or cause suffering or hunger, etc. Best bet for civilians is to stay low or get out.\n\n3) you are somehow not number 1), but you are still a combatant, because you either took up arms and are a partisan/guerilla/terrorist/gangster, or you came from abroad to fight and are a mercenary/volunteer/legionnaire. What that means that not only you are disposable for EVERYONE INVOLVED, but also means that NO treaties, conventions apply to you, and neither \"your side\", nor the enemies owe you anything.

            "text": "Hi,\n\nHow have Russian maps been drawn since 1991?  Is there something different about our maps that gives Russia their apparent sense of entitlement to invade their peaceful, sovereign neighbors without provocation?\n\nFor instance, after 1991 Georgia and Ukraine have been drawn as their own countries on our maps in \"the west\".  Chechnya, however, was drawn inside Russia, basically like a country surrounded by Russia that did not appear truly sovereign or autonomous. \n\nDo post-1991 maps in Russia look like a western map where Ukraine and Georgia are completely independent?  Or are they like our maps of Chechnya, and Ukraine and Georgia still appear as if they exist inside of Russia geo-politically?\n\nThere hasn't appeared to be nearly as much alarm about either Georgia or especially Chechnya being invaded by Russia among people in \"the west\". Sentiment likely includes class, religion, and ethnicity as factors influencing our tepid sentiment, as conversely \"the west\" went completely fucking mental seeing a relatively wealthy, technologically advanced country full of white Christians bordering western Europe being invaded.\n\nBut back to the map, how much of the Russian attitude is how the maps are drawn? Are Russia and \"the west\"'s maps drawn the same, but it seems more acceptable to invade Ukraine and Georgia to Russians due to lingering generational entitlement to subjugate former Soviet countries?  Or are they straight-up drawn inside Russia's borders like \"the west\"'s maps of Chechnya still are today?  \n\nBecause that's basically what it sounds like to my ear when I hear Russians talk about the country and the people of Ukraine. The sentiment I observe suggests to me Russians never acknowledged Ukraine's autonomy.  Either that, or there is shockingly little regard for sovereignty of neighboring countries in Russia. \n\nHow much does state media's conspiracy theories about NATO planning to attack Russia from Ukraine play into the sentiment?  Is fear-based preemptive attack-supporting pseudo-strategy prevalent among the Russian public?  If so, I've seen it myself, even if I didn't share their concern or blood lust.  But, as an American, there was a kind of \"we'd better get them before they get us\" idiocy I remember fomenting in 2003, when we horrified the global community by invading Iraq.\n\nAnyway, hope this post wasn't tl;dr. I've been wondering this thing about the maps and attitudes for a while now, so I'm really grateful for this sub.  It's more important now than any other point in our lifetimes.  Thanks in advance for sharing, and as always, please take care of your safety as much as humanly possible.",

It had subdivisions, one of them was called RSFSR, another one was called Ukrainian SSR, there were others but they are unrelated to the topic.\n\nIn USSR its SSRs had legal right for secession. So in the 1991 two SSRs in question did exactly that. Sidenote: out of this two first to declare sovereignty (\" we are gone! \") was RSFSR, 12.06.1990 vs 16.07.1990, but first to declare independence (\"and we are not coming back!\") was Ukrainian SSR, 27.08.1991 vs 12.12.1991. Last SSR to declare independence was Kazakh SSR btw.\n\nSo as Ukraine's independence was never a topic to discuss with Russia, it was a topic to discuss with USSR, just like Russia's independence.Russia seceded from USSR with the lovely borders pretty much whole world was happily seing up until 2014 and no, Japan, this is not the place.\n\nChechnya never was a SSR.

During the Olympics in 1980, amid the boycott related to the war in Afghanistan, American brands like Pepsi still sold their products in USSR without an issue. Today they seemingly have to hide who they are to do that. Consider that the supply of weapons, training, and finances to Bin Laden's Mujahideen had to be hidden, routed through Pakistan's government institutions, with the CIA keeping its operation there secret. Today, the US and its allies supply weapons openly and with very little restraint, publicly stating that their goal is a strategic defeat for Russia. Consider as well that during the Cold War, the US never performed any overt action that could be seen as an attack on USSR's assets. Today, it either sponsors, coordinates, or possibly even gets personally involved in acts of industrial terrorism on Russia's infrastructure (including joint infrastructure, such as with Nordstream), and seizes Russia's property abroad. \n\nThis current spin on the Cold War is quite firmly more tense than anything before, bar the Cuban missile crisis.

As long as one side stands the risk is high and the other would do their best to diminish it.

Noone would believe me, even myself. And after... Well, shit's happened already.\n\nNoone will widthdraw troops from Ukraine now, it just won't happen. And in current state Ukraine can't negotiate for peace without admitting full capitulation, which they won't do... Ukraine forces don't have any playable political cards for now except time, and without direct support from NATO defeat is imminent... Question is when, and how much blood will it take.",

They don't.\n\nIt would be cool to travel in time 20-25 years back and to derail Ukraine from antirrussian path, but at that times Russia was weak and didn't have influence. It's unrealistic even having a time machine. \n\nMaybe the only possibility is to go back to 80's and prevent USSR from collapse? Who knows...",

Redditors, who made the corrections & adding, please excuse me.*\n\n**So basically daily the threads as Ask a Russian, Moscow etc are full of questions regarding traveling to RU.**\n\n**Seeing all this, i give a try to summarize the basic info about traveling & i will try to update this main post, also i would appreciate expats & recent travelers on tips & tricks based on the recent traveling experience.**\n\n***Note 1.*** *This is not the post about politics, it's purely for traveling questions & day to day life.*\n\n***Note 2.*** *I am writing this post based on my knowledge & experience as a Moscow resident, info may vary based on your destination. Also, most of the time i will refer to Moscow & SPb as a main entry point for travelers, but this limitation basically on my understanding that people arrive in these cities as a start. I will try to update the post with necessary and useful information based on the comments (if any arrive :) ).*\n\n***Note 3.*** *As there are some restrictions to ru domains on reddit, just delete the space in the link before . ru domain.*\n\n**Q: Is it safe traveling to Russia in current situation?**\n\n>**A**: Pretty safe. The major cities as Moscow & SPb are the big cities with the same issues you can find all around the globe (scammers, big city risks, inadequate people, heavy traffic etc.).The area of risk (in the current situation) mostly limited to the adjacent territories, close to Ukraine border. In general Moscow & SPb are the modern cities, multicultural. We normally don't care if you are black, white, asian, hispanic, if your believe in krishna, if you are gay or whatsoever. The main principle i would say is: a clear understanding of what you are doing and separate common sense and propaganda, both informational and propaganda of any values. In general if you are a tourist or coming here as an expat for work just live a normal live, all possibilities are here.\n\n**Q: How to get to Russia by air?**\n\n>**A:** One of the biggest & well known tickets aggregators - [Aviasales](https://www.aviasales.com/) available at ru & com domains & also popular [OneTwoTrip](https://www.onetwotrip.com/). \\\\  \n>  \n>*Today there are direct flights to 38 countries: Azerbaijan, Israel, DPRK, Syria, Algeria, India, Maldives, Tajikistan, Armenia, Iraq, Morocco, Thailand, Afghanistan, Iran, Mongolia, Tunisia, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Turkmenistan, Belarus, Qatar, UAE, Turkey, Venezuela, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, China, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Georgia, Cuba Islands, Ethiopia, Egypt, Kuwait, Serbia.*\n\n**Q: Hot to get to Russian by land and travel across Russia?**\n\n>**A:** easy part, internal travelling.rzd. ru - is an official website of a Russian railroads, where you can by tickets & see the timetables.Normally you don't have any restrictions with travelling across RU e.g. by car, though, as everywhere in the world, there might be restrictions to certain areas (closed towns as an example). So, yes, in general, you can go by car to Spb, Siberia or elsewhere.  \n>  \n>*\"Foreign citizens have the right to freedom of movement for personal or business purposes within the Russian Federation on the basis of documents issued or executed by them in accordance with this Federal Law, with the exception of visits to territories, organizations and facilities for which a special permit is required to enter in accordance with federal laws.\"*  \n>  \n>***International railroad travel:*** former intl. routes of RZD to Berlin, Nice, Paris obviously suspended.Up to the news: currently, 39 international passenger trains have resumed running with 6 countries in communication with the CIS and Baltic countries: the Republic of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia. RZD trains, at the same time, run only to Belarus and Mongolia. The rest of the international trains are formed by neighboring states. Communication with China, North Korea and Azerbaijan has not been resumed yet.  \n>  \n>***Land border crossing:*** *Frankly speaking, this is the terra incognita for me. So i can just mention what web search gives to me.\"A foreign tourist can enter Russia by any means of transport. Yes, a visa is required to enter the Russian Federation for a foreign citizen or a stateless person. If there is an agreement, it is possible for foreign citizens to enter the Russian Federation without visas.\"*  \\\\  \n>  \n>**Bus connection?** Redditors mentioned a bus connection Tallin - Spb, seems to work ok.  \n>  \n>*No matter which of the countries of the Eurasia Customs Union (EACU) you enter, there is the same set of rules for everyone who enters one of the countries of CU by their own vehicle. The main and basic rule is that one owner (driver) can enter only one vehicle without paying customs deposit, without the right to transfer ownership and operating of the vehicle to other persons. This means that when crossing the border, the driver will be required to fill out a Customs Declaration, in which he must specify the point of entry (Country) and point of exit (Country), the period of stay of the vehicle on the territory of the Customs Union. The vehicle must be driven out by the same owner (driver) as indicated in the customs Declaration.*  \n>  \n>**~~BUS VIA FINLAND: 16 NOV 23 UPDATE~~** ~~Ground connection via Finland seems to be suspended, as Finland closes the RU-FI land border. Ecolines, LuxExpress - stopping as of today their routes.~~  \n>  \n>**~~UPDATE as of 12 DEC 2023:~~** ~~The Finnish government intends to open three major border crossings on the border with Russia — Vaalimaa, Nuiyamaa and Imatra, writes (~~[~~https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000010052082.html~~](https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000010052082.html) ~~) the Finnish edition of Ilta-Sanomat with reference to its own sources.~~  \n>  \n>**RU - FIN border IS CLOSED, no busses**  \n>  \n>**When driving the following documents should be carried:**  \n>  \n>\\- passenger customs declaration  \n>  \n>\\- foreign registration certificate of the vehicle  \n>  \n>\\- civil passport and international passport (valid for at least six months after the date you plan to enter a foreign country)  \n>  \n>\\- valid visas (if needed) to all planned countries of the Customs Union along the route  \n>  \n>\\- international driving permit/ national driving permit (all the data is written in Latin)  \n>  \n>\\- insurance (third part) issued for the entire planned period of stay of the vehicle on the territory of the EEU (CTP Insurance policy for each planned country of the customs Union is issued directly at the border crossing points after passing the customs authority)\n\n**Q: is Russia open for travelling & visas?**\n\n>**A:** Yes. info from U.S. Embassy & Consulates: To enter Russia for any purpose, a U.S. citizen must possess a valid U.S. passport and a bona fide visa issued by a Russian Embassy or Consulate. It is impossible to obtain an entry visa upon arrival, so travelers must apply for their visas in as per comments, advance. \\\\  \n>  \n>**NOTE** US & UK tourists are getting visas, no restrictions highlighted.  \n>  \n>Basically, standard as always, Russia (to my knowledge) didn't suspend any tourism. You will need a valid passport, up-to-date photos, confirmations (tickets, hotels etc.).  \n>  \n>\\*Q3 2023 Russia started a [project](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/nationals-of-eu-schengen-countries-now-eligible-for-russia-e-visa/) with e-visa. Based on the article, e-visa can be obtained for citizens of: Andorra, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, The Democratic  People’s Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Myanmar, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Türkiye, Vatican City, Vietnam.*Always check the local embassy rules!*  \n>  \n>\\*\\*\\*E-VISA to Russia:\\*\\*\\***application form:** [https://evisa](https://evisa). kdmid. ru/**basic info:** [https://electronic-visa](https://electronic-visa). kdmid  .ru/index\\_en.html\n\n**Q: I am from UK/US - straight to jail at the border?**\n\n>**A:** If you are personally not under sanctions, not sent for the purpose of espionage or data collection, but a regular tourist nothing to worry about. Again, restrictions for any citizens of certain countries are not reported. Travel as usual, you are welcome.\n\n**Q: what's with the accommodation?**\n\n>**A:** Chains still available: Accor Hotels, Radisson HG, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Lotte Hotels & Resorts, Soluxe Hotel Group, Corinthia Hotels, Domina Hotels, Louvre HG, Kempinski Hotels, Rosewood Hotels and Rocco Forte Hotels. Their total number of rooms is more than 60% of the total supply of network operators.  \n>  \n>**UPD:** check ostrovok . ru for accomodations, this site works on the same principle of booking.com & offers a varienty of stays as hotels, appartments and so on. Available in multi languages, but i am not sure if they accept foreign cards. If anyone tried, please let me know in the comments.  \n>  \n>Also the above mentioned Aviasales & OneTwoTrip (12Trip redirect ya to ostrovok) can give you a booking for tickets + hotels.\n\n**Q: Do i need a registration to be in RU?**\n\n>**A:** YES. mandatory registration for foreigners & tourists. as of october 2023: Starting from September 15, 2023, all foreign citizens coming to our country as tourists are required to undergo the registration procedure. This requirement will apply to all tourists, regardless of their country of residence and the purpose of visiting Russia.  \n>  \n>Registration for tourists is available through a specialized electronic portal, where it will be necessary to provide personal data and information about the planned stay in the country. In addition, tourists will need to pay a state fee for the provision of registration services.  \n>  \n>Registration is mandatory and must be completed within the first 24 hours after arrival in the country. Tourists will need to keep a confirmation of registration and present it if necessary during their stay in Russia.  \n>  \n>In case of violation of registration requirements, tourists may be subject to penalties, including deportation from the country. Therefore, it is recommended that all foreign tourists comply with this rule and register in a timely manner after arriving in Russia.  \n>  \n>**Migration card**  \n>  \n>The migration card is given to foreigners free of charge in the transport following to Russia: by plane, train or bus. If you cross the border by car, then you need to take a migration card from the border police. The card must be filled out and do not forget to specify the purpose of entry: tourism, work, study, private visit, etc. If you write the purpose of the visit incorrectly, for example, tourism instead of work, it will be impossible to get a work permit in the future.  \n>  \n>The completed card must be presented at the border control. The border guard officer take part of the piece of paper for himself, put a seal on the rest and give it back. The second part of the card must be kept during the trip and given to the border guard upon return. In case of loss of a migration card, you need to get a duplicate within 3 days at the nearest branch of the Federal Migration Service (FMS).  \n>  \n>Citizens of Belarus are not required to fill out a migration card and give it to border guards, since there is a simplified entry regime between Russia and Belarus.  \n>  \n>**upd, by** u/MikeSeth *Registration for foreigners: If you stay more than 7 days in Russia you must submit registration within the first seven days together with your host. Do not do this via egov, because you will not get the slip that serves as proof of submission until your registration is processed which can take weeks unlike the post office and МФЦ procedure where your slip is given to you as soon as you submit the form. You need to carry this slip and the migration card they gave you at the border with you at all times. The cops will assume you're an illegal otherwise. When engaging any services that require identification, which includes hotel registration, railway tickets, SIM cards, banks accounts etc you need to present both your foreign passport AND the migration card. Do not lose it and do not leave home without it.*\n\n**-------------------------------------------------**\n\n**So you've been able to get all the necessary docs & flying to RU.Moscow**3 main airports: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), Vnukovo (VKO) + a smaller Zhukovsky (ZIA).They are all quite distant from the city. I would say less fortunate & hard reaching is ZIA.\n\nSpb: Pulkovo (LED).\n\n**Q: How to reach the airport / city**\n\n>**A:** In general, there are all available methods.  \n>  \n>*Moscow:* Aeroexpress trains which will get you to the interim stops or end point a railway station close to the city center. Buses & VKO just got an own metro station integrated to the moscow subway network, taxi.  \n>  \n>*Spb,* as i know it's quite the same as Moscow: metro, buses, taxi \\*(as per comments, unfortunately, no aeroexpress train city - pulkovo terminal availabA HUGE advantage for foreign le).\n\n**Q: Is Uber available?**\n\n>**A:** Nope. Before 2018 Uber was available, but in 2018 started a project of M&A btw Uber & Yandex, as of 2023, all uber activities & shares passed to Ya.\n\n**Q: So what are the apps for taxis?**\n\n>**A:** **1st option** (most popular): Yandex Go [ios](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81-go-%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8-%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0/id472650686) & [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.taxi&hl=en&gl=US). Operates mostly everywhere in RU. A ride is offered on a fixed rate.Variety of classes: Economy (VW Polo, Hyundai Solaris/Accent or similar), Comfort (Hyundai i40, Elantra or similar), Comfort+ (Camry, Optima, Sonata or similar), Minivan (VW Caddy, C4 Picasso etc); followed by Ultima class: Business (5-er, E-cl.), Premier (A8, S-cl or similar), Elite (Maybach), Cruise (MB V-Class).As you are most likely don't have a local card or a friend with the one of local cards, Yandex Go can be paid with cash (choose in the app).Ya Go has the inbuilt translator for a chat with a driver, so you can chat in yr language and see the translation from RU.  \n>  \n>**!!!IMPORTANT!!! - Only pay what's stated in the app. If the driver asks for more, do not pay!!! Drivers try to scam people for transfer rides the cases are frequent, be aware!** The only exception is toll roads, BUT ALWAYS ASK FOR A RECEIPT from a toll road terminal (550-400 rub SVO - Moscow, depending on the terminal, as of today (4-5 eur)). ***ALSO*** be aware if you pay cash, always better to have a perfect amount to cover the ride or have a cash close to the sum. What i mean, drivers will try to say they don't have change and will try to round up. So keep in mind having the change. Well, it's the same all over the globe with cash rides in the taxi, here you will see no difference.  \n>  \n>Also, (personal experience) better to use higher classes, lot's of cases with economy & comfort. (not all drivers for sure are bad, but the number is high).  \n>  \n>**AND ALSO**\\* When you are entering a terminal of the airport after a secure zone, you will see a big number of people offerening a taxi, wearing some badges, maybe having a walki-talkies in hands. THIS SHOULD BE AVOIDED! DO NOT TALK TO THEM, SCAM! I remember there was an official booth of Yandex Taxi in SVO (Sheremetyevo) terminals, thats ok, but better use the app, which you downloaded in advance!  \n>  \n>**2nd option**, a premium one - Wheely. \\*Confirmed by support to work with international cards (but download and check in advance!)!\\*We have a premium chauffeur service (basically a taxi) called Wheely, [ios](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/wheely/id380732645) & [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wheely.wheely&hl=ru).A Russian service now operates also in London, Paris, Dubai. In RU available in Moscow, SPb & Sochi. No fixed rates, only for transfers & city wise only pay what you ride (min + milage).A HUGE advantage for foreign travelers: a) you can create a ride in advance, stating a flight no. and driver will track your flight, b) you can ask for an english speaking driver in advance (other languages, ask support), c) you can choose an option of pick-up at the exit. So when you got your luggage & leaving the clear zone and entering a terminal, a driver with a branded board with your name on it will wait for you, will help with your belongings & guide you to the car.  \n>  \n>Classes: Business (E, 5 ser.), First (S-Class), Luxe (Maybach), XL (MB V-Class).\n\n**Q: Money. Cards are not working, right?**\n\n>**A:** Yep. RU is isolated from the rest of the world. So, you are not able to use your cards here. Some exceptions for CN Union Pay system.  \n>  \n>Basic rule: You can import up to 10,000 USD in cash and in traveler's checks (not incl. funds on cards). If you have more money, you will have to declare your cache amount and show documents explaining the origin of the funds. It is also necessary to declare any securities, valuables in laguage and so on. ***Note from redditors:*** better to have a normal looking banknotes: not falling into pieces, torn ...etc.  \n>  \n>Also, that does't mean bringing only USD. In 2023, it is allowed to import funds into the territory of the Russian Federation without a declaration in an amount equivalent to no more than 10,000 USD in any currency of the world  \n>  \n>The import of foreign currency is considered in dollar equivalent at the exchange rate of the Central Bank on the day of the trip.\n\n**Q: Can i get a local debit card & make crypto transfer?**\n\n>**A:** Yep! Thanks to the comment of u/violin1776 in the comments, he had in Aug 2023 an experience with Sberbank (one of the largest banks). ***How to get a debit card:***  \n>  \n>Find a suitable [office](https://www.sberbank.com/ru/oib?tab=vsp)  \n>  \n>Take the original passport with you & some cash to make a deposit on your accout (either cashier desk or ATM).  \n>  \n>Better to have a local sim in advance for a contract signage (never tried, but Sberbank has a sbermobile virtual operator, so most likely you can get a simcard at the bank office \\[SberMobile list of offices: [https://sbermobile](https://sbermobile). ru/officesmap).  \n>  \n>Open an account & ask for a free momentum MIR debit card  \n>  \n>If you wish a crypto transfers, ask to install an app for you AT THE OFFICE (they know how to do that, did that with my new iphone).  \n>  \n>Now you have the local card - pay anywhere, incl. public transport.  \n>  \n>***SWIFT TRANSFERS*** if you need them, the banks with not blocked swift transfers in RU: Raiffeisenbank, Unicredit, Citibank, Ak-Bars Bank, Home Credit Bank, Russian Standard, OTP Bank, Renaissance Bank and Avangard have not fallen under the sanctions. Subsidiaries of Western banks such as Citibank, Unicredit and Raiffeisen are now operating mostly without restrictions.  \n>  \n>*But there are nuances:* (as of JUL 2023, before transfers, check current rates!) For example, Citibank no longer opens new accounts in currency or even in rubles. \"Unicredit accepts new clients, but asks to get a card with a premium rate. Such a card will cost 1500 ₽ per month.  \n>  \n>**The easiest way to transfer money to Raiffeisenbank.** The commission for SWIFT-transfer via mobile application or Internet bank will be 2% of the transfer amount, but not less than $200 and not more than $300. When sending a transfer through a bank branch, the fee will be 3% of the amount. The minimum transfer amount is $10,000., only valid for USD, EUR & other currencies should have only 500 rub fee, but always check!  \n>  \n>***Pre-ordered bedit card*** A tourist debit card, which should be ordered in advance is now in development, but not launched, somewhat in the near future, will keep updated.  \n>  \n>***UPD from 08 DEC 2023*** a project has started, recently saw some news that 1 company started to take real actions.  \n>  \n>\"foreigners can apply for a card at home: to do this, they need to download the YooMoney application for Android, register, issue a virtual card and go through full identification. Upon arrival in Russia, a tourist can receive a plastic card, or continue to use only the virtual form, since purchases can be paid using NFC or a QR code.  \n>  \n>“Foreign tourists can receive an instant bank card of the Mir payment system at Sheremetyevo Airport right in the arrivals area. full article in comments section\" **PLEASE SOMEONE TRY DOWNLOADING YOOMONEY APP & TRY TO OPEN A CARD AND REPLY IN COMMENTS!**  \n>  \n>UPD: **Q: Any other methods?A:** It was mentioned by redditors, that you can use this method aswell *\"Advcash can accept wire transfers or convert crypto to rub at decent rates and deposit to a Russian debit card. Usdt recommended. 100k rub transfers to Tinkoff work.\"* \\\\\n\n**Q: Ok, so than i have to bring cash, how & where to exchange.**\n\n>**A:** Change some amount at the airport (rate is shitty for sure) for your travel to hotel or where are you heading. Then go the bank in the city to change there. OR you can always find an exchange office @ [https://cash.rbc](https://cash.rbc). ru .You will see the map & offered rate, normally higher than regular banks, but use with caution, so that cashier not disappear with your money :)))\n\n**Q: Travelling in Moscow. How to use public transort.**\n\n>**A:** Yandex Maps ([ios](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-maps-navigator/id313877526) , [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en&gl=US)) + Yandex Metro ([ios](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-metro/id392589075) , [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.metro&hl=ru)) - an optimal bundle for your stay, also google maps work perfectly. *ALSO* another app popular for navigation is 2GIS [ios](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/2%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%81-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D1%8B-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0/id481627348) & [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5475543677782911277&hl=ru&gl=US).  \n>  \n>At metro station or MCC train or in airports (moscow central circle railroad) you can purchase a city travel card - TROIKA (Moscow) & Podorozhnik (SPb).You can top up money on it & use in public transport.

The prescription should indicate that the drug is intended specifically for a foreign or Russian citizen passing through the border for treatment, that is, for personal use. And also the prescription should indicate the disease or syndrome for which the medication was prescribed. The dosage and amount of the drug must be indicated in the prescription.*  \n>  \n>*If the recipe is written in a foreign language, then you must have a notarized translation into Russian.*  \n>  \n>*It is prohibited for third parties to transport medicines to Russian territory.

Most of them can be visited in 1 day, but in many places you'd love to stay for more :)\n\n**Q: Social networks, are they available?**\n\n>**A:** Insta, FB, Linkedin - only can be viewed with the use of VPN. So if you try to contact people, be sure that they have vpn to get your messages, getting notifications is difficult.\n\n**Q: Public wifi access?**\n\n>**A:** Airport should be fine using the foreign cell numbers, free public wifi is a big question for me (most likely a local numbers only), so better to have a local sim upon arrival. Most of cafes & restaurants normally have a wifi at their places.  \n>  \n>**UPD from comments: DME airport require only local +7 numbers!**\n\n**Q: Money transfers?**\n\n>**A:** If you suceeded with local card (not under sanctions should be: Raiffeisenbank, Unicredit, Citibank, Ak-Bars Bank, Home Credit Bank, Russian Standard, OTP Bank, Renaissance Bank and Avangard - details read above, restrictions are there), than you can make a swift transfer from a local bank to your account in RU **OR** use largest crypto services.  \n>  \n>**UPD by** u/dair_spb\\*\\*:\\*\\*  \\*it's worth to add that Raiffeisenbank introduced a 50% (fifty percent, a half!) commission on incoming USD transfers.  \n>  \n>[https://www.raiffeisen](https://www.raiffeisen) \\[dot\\] ru/about/press/news/201900/  \n>  \n>And it's 50% up to $500, but still, quite noticeable for most transfers I believe.\\*\n\n**Q: wired / crypto transfers.**\n\n>**A:** normally you can safely use the biggest crypto exchange platforms as: Binance, Bybit or Huobi. You can top up the balance via card to platform or P2P method.  \n>  \n>**advacash** As mentioned by u/MikeSeth  \n>  \n>*Advcash can accept wire transfers or convert crypto to rub at decent rates and deposit to a Russian debit card. Usdt recommended. 100k rub transfers to Tinkoff work.*  \n>  \n>***Ok, i would add some basic stuff regarding most frequent questions in Moscow & AskaRussian thread i see.***\n\n**Q: I have someone in RU and would love to send them a gift, how?**\n\n>**A:** I would suggest 2 options at this moment  \n>  \n>Seems that **OZON \\[DOT\\] RU** (massive russian marketplace like amazon) accepts foreign cards, i was able to read such an info.Ozon in the top left corner has a possibility to change the currency, eg to USD. But translation option was not found, seems that you should use an in-build translation in your browser.**UPD Feb 24** \\- in comments we got a confirmation that a purchase from a card issued in Italy worked perfectly for purchasing a gift cart.  \n>  \n>As ozon is a marketplace, there's always a possibility that fake / replicas will be on sale, so have a clear head ordering smth  \n>  \n>2. Also possibly you might use a forwarders as Qwintry, CDEK Global Forwarding, LITE FM, Shopfans. How it works - register yrself on a platform, get an address (eg USA or EU), order what you want with you card at any onlinestore and deliver to the address you have from the system (eg Delaware warehouse for no taxes).  \n>  \n>***CHECK THE LIMITATIONS / SANCTIONS LIST ON THE PLATFORMS!!!***  \n>  \n>Once goods arrive, they will appear in yr account & will be sent to a person in RU with the data you provided.\n\n**Q: I want to send some money to my relatives in RU, i heard of crypto, but how to send**\n\n>**A:** Hello grandma'! So you are in (nearly 2024) but google & youtube are some weird words to you, let me google it for you...  \n>  \n>***My suggestion based on experience - choose Tether (USDT), which is a stablecoin issued by Tether and pegged to the US dollar in value.***  \n>  \n>As an example we will use ByBit axchange platform (but basically they are all the same. Binance, Bybit, Huobi... different, but all the same) - here you can see how to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJIz3F56WRQ&ab\\_channel=BybitP2PTradingGuide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJIz3F56WRQ&ab_channel=BybitP2PTradingGuide)  \n>  \n>**Basically simple steps:** register, verify, go to topup section and choose what you like as a topup method (crypto, direct card, sideplatfroms as advacash, revolute, p2p, etc), once you have USDT on your account switch to p2p and convert USDT to RUB directly to a local card. P2P is an instant action, in roughly 30 min money is on a needed card.\n\n**Q: Can i rent a car**\n\n>**A:** To my knowledge all car rentals of worldwide car rentals quit. (hertz long ago, as failed to compete with carsharing)... BUT Avis / Budget did the rebrandig and now called REXRENT (rexrent \\[DOT\\] ru)  \n>  \n>UPD Feb '24: Travellers were able to register with carsharing (they also offer ability for riding outside moscow): BelkaCar [ios](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%88%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3-belkacar-%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE/id1113709902) & [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.belkacar.belkacar&hl=ru).  \n>  \n>Cars are available in most airports, so you might get an account in advance.\n\n**STAY TUNED.**",

                "No mentions of the Gulag Koshmar?\n\nDisappointed. \n\nJK, great FAQ.",
                "I arrived to Moscow on 12/4 via Turkish airline (one of the worst airline in my opinion lol they charge everything even wifi at the IST airport) Here are some experiences I went through regards to foreign people (especially usa citizens)\n\n1. Passport control upon arrival - they did not go through my phone or made me wait to talk to fsb agent. There was british guy next to me and he had no problem as well. At first it feels scary (it was young russian lady who looked over my passport and tourist visa) she took time to make sure information and passport is legit. I was scared  tbh. I said thank you in Russian (she smiled and let me go without any issue). She will give you migration card and you just have to sign your name and keep this piece of paper till you leave (will try to update this info after i arrive USA safely) There were two guys who were turned away (two of them were from African). I think they had to go talk to someone it seems like. I am assuming visa issue.\n\n2. Russian airlines - i see many news regarding many of the russian planes having issues (due to sanction and airplane parts issue) I had to go visit my gf sister in tolyatti. Again, planes are functional and working properly \n\n3. Cost - me and my gf is renting apartment for 1 month which cost around 70,000 ruble. Small americano cost around 160 ruble (i love coffee so my cost of living is based on americano lol). Unless you have expensive taste enjoying fine dinning groceries are cheaper when you cook. We spent 8000 rubles for 1 month grocery. Taxi is also cheaper compared to uber (1000 to 1500 depending on the distance around moscow. We been enjoying metro which is like 54 ruble per ride). I say if you travel alone for few weeks 1000 to 1500 usd should be decent (without the cost of the rent). Rents can be cheaper too, i did not book the apartment but for my standard its hella cheap since 700 dollar can only last week if you stay in Europe hotel from my personal experience.\n\n4. Russian people - super nice and mind their own business. I was like only korean guy in the train and they didnt even gave me any dirty look. I got so many dirty look when i visited berlin lol it was so uncomfortable. As long as you respect law in Russia you wont have any issues. I always say thank you in russian and some people appreciate this despite not being able to speak any russian. \n\n5. Cash - try to get newer 100 dollar bills from the bank before traveling to Russia. It can be difficult to get good condition bills but you really have to ask and try different bank to better bills. When traveling i do recommend setting up crypto account and your digital wallet (using coinbase + trusted wallet). I brought cash and crypto (cash for emergency and crypto for main use) i didnt get the caed here since i am just using my gf card. Rule of thumb in travel is to always bring more for emergency and expect the unexpected. I say for first time travelers bring both. When i am coming russia next year again, i will reduce amount of cash i will bring and just use crypto (i used bestchange.ru). \n\n6. Vpn - just download many vpn as possible. I am currently using planet vpn. Tbh i barely use vpn unless i wanna use instagram or buy something from American website while i am traveling (amazon or bestbuy or nintendo eshop). There is no ads in YouTube which has been game changer lol. I work in digital marketing so i found this to be amazing. \n\nFinal thoughts - i think before traveling i consumed too many news media because russia to me was such an unknown place. But just remember people live the same everywhere. They are too busy to pay attention to random foreigners. Its safe to travel as foreigner and i will be looking forward to visit hopefully during the summer time. I hope traveling to russia becomes more easier near future. Спасибо everyone!",
                "I have just travelled to Moscow from London and wanted to share some of my experience in case it helps any others on their future travels.\n\nI am a British citizen and entered Russia on a single entry tourist visa. I travelled with my partner who is a Latvian citizen with a multiple entry business visa. She was born and raised in Moscow and is a native Russian speaker. Her mother and brother also live in Moscow.\n\n\\-- We flew from Heathrow to Domodedovo with Azerbaijan Airlines via Baku. It was the shortest journey we could find. 10h35 total, including a 1h45 layover. The tickets were relatively cheap, £440 each including checked luggage. Everything about the flight was completely normal and smooth. Our visas were checked at the baggage drop in London and our luggage was checked straight through to Moscow. Baku airport is super modern and comfortable. Overall a fantastic experience flying with Azerbaijan through Baku. Much nicer than a budget airline option.\n\n\\-- Upon landing at DME, we went straight to passport control (each to separate desks). They looked at my passport for ages and then asked to see my boarding pass. After a few minutes, a separate agent came up to the window and took me with them. They had my partner and her passport too. We were asked to wait in a holding area with many other people. After about 10-15 minutes, my partner and I were taken together into a separate room and questioned by two other agents. My partner speaks Russian, so things were relatively straightforward. They asked us general questions about our stay, what we do for work, who we are, etc. We both work in film production so they also asked what camera equipment we were bringing in and also what books/literature we had with us. They were all just questions, we were not searched in any way. I have a Ukrainian stamp in my passport from a job I did there in 2020 so was obviously asked about that. However, everything did seem quite casual and conversational. They took the IMEI numbers and British phone numbers of our phones but didn't look through the phones themselves or ask us to unlock them. This info was written down on a piece of paper. After around 15 minutes in the room, we were sent back to the holding area without our passports. After around 20 minutes in the holding area, they came back, gave us our passports and sent us through the border again. We passed without issue. The whole thing took around an hour and there were many other people in the same situation. It felt a little strange given the current situation, but looking back on it, it wasn't that bad. It didn't feel intimidating, just a longer wait than expected.\n\n\\-- After reading this thread, I opened a YooMoney account before leaving London. Getting money onto it was relatively straightforward as I knew someone in Russia. I bought stable crypto (USDT) and sent it to my brother in law. He then bought rubles and transferred it to the YooMoney account. NOTE: As a foreigner, you can only open an \"anonymous\" account until you verify your identity in-person. With this, you have a 15,000 ruble limit on your account. Given that, the YooMoney situation is decent to get you started, but without knowing someone with a Russian account, I couldn't figure out any way of loading money onto it. Once you verify your identity, the account becomes a lot more useful, but you have to do that in-person in Russia if you are not a Russian citizen. I never bothered verifying my identity as I ended up getting another account (more below!). However I did order a physical card which was handy. It said it would take 14 days to arrive, but was delivered within a week to our local post office.\n\n\\-- Considering this, I would still recommend taking a small amount of cash. We exchanged £25GBP at the airport, which allowed me to buy a local e-sim at the airport. There were desks for all the major service providers right outside the arrivals door, along with a currency exchange. I got an e-sim with unlimited data and minutes from Tele2, which cost me 2000 rub (£20).\n\n\\-- Our more permanent solution for the money was to just go to our local Sberbank branch and open an account. It was extremely straightforward. All I needed was my passport and migration card. The account is free and without any limits. You also get a physical card on the spot, which is useful if you have an iPhone as Apple Pay does not work at all within Russia. NOTE: You MUST have a local phone number to do this. Like most services in Russia, you use your phone number to confirm your identity. Without a local phone number I wouldn't have been able to open the account.\n\n\\-- Overall just getting the Sberbank account would have been easiest. Just bringing some cash to exchange at the airport and then using that to get an e-sim and a taxi into the city would have been fine. Then straight to Sberbank to get that card. YooMoney is legit and is an option, but doesn't really feel any more convenient. If I were able to remotely verify my identity, this would be different.\n\n\\-- Neither the YooMoney or Sberbank apps are available on iOS at the moment. However it is easy enough to bookmark their web clients and save them on your home page.\n\n\\-- If you want to use your usual social media sites, you will need a VPN. We used VanyaVPN which works perfectly on iOS and Mac. We paid for a single 50rub (£5) subscription that gives you unlimited use for 15 days. One subscription was enough for both of our phones and laptops. We can then use our devices as if we're in the UK.\n\n\\-- Another thing to mention is that car sharing is extremely popular in Moscow and relatively cheap compared to London. I managed to get an account with a service called Belka, which accepted my UK driving license and passport. This, combined with YandexGo (basically Uber) and the super cheap Moscow metro/buses made getting round so easy. One thing to note is that GPS in the very centre of Moscow doesn't work too well. The gov are scrambling the signal to defend themselves against drones. It's not a complete pain, but just be ready to use the map in a more old-school sense.\n\n\\-- Google Maps works well but doesn't have any public transport routing (fine for driving and walking). I'd recommend downloading Yandex Maps if you're using public transport.\n\nOverall we have had a great time in Moscow. It is a vibrant, huge city where everything feels very modern and convenient. I can't wait to visit again in the summer!\n\nHappy to answer any additional questions :)",

Minsk agreements had Germany as a guarantor, Germany did fucking nothing to force Kiev to implement them betraying second side of Ukraine in a deal.\n\n>Do you feel that could be a credible political solution ?

RE breaks up, Crimea becomes part of Russians Republic first and than RSFSR, stays so within USSR. Than there is the “300 years of unification of Russia and Ukraine” and Khrushchev (a Ukrainian) gives Crimea to Ukrainian SSR  from Russians SFSR within the USSR, why? Because “it’s easier to govern” overall nobody cared because it was still one country so nothing changed really. (Think of Nevada giving a chunk of it to California, nothing changes for most people) of course this changes in 1991 when the Union falls apart and we all are independent.Here it again was not a problem as we were allies and Sevastopol was leased to Russia for 50 years anyway because of the fleet, but in 2013-14 shit hits the fan and Putin decides to get RF army in Crimea and support the rising protests. Small period of Independence and Putin accepts Crimea and Sevastopol as new federal subjects of the Federation, Referendum could have been faked.

The city of Sevastopol, not being part of Crimea, never even had that semblance of a reason to be in Ukraine. And the 1994 document \"recognizing\" Ukraine's borders was the result of successful nuclear blackmail. Ukraine  basically said it either gets to steal a bunch of Russian nukes or it gets to steal a bunch of Russians. You stop negotiating with terrorists the moment they lose their leverage. Crimea should've been reclaimed by Russia decades earlier."

                "As a result of a government coup initiated by Western countries, elites loyal to the United States, as well as neo-Nazis, came to power in Ukraine. Even before the beginning of all the events, when the Euromaidan was just beginning, anti-Russian slogans were heard in Ukraine, many of which were extremely radical, for example, to hang Russians. Seeing this development of events, the regions with a predominantly Russian population considered it impossible for themselves to continue to be part of Ukraine.\r  \n\r  \nAs a result of a referendum in which foreign observers were also present, Crimea became part of Russia. This made it possible to avoid the genocide of the Russians in the Crimea. The embittered Ukrainian government, with the support of the West and neo-Nazi battalions, began the genocide of Russians in Lugansk and Donetsk. I do not understand why the Russian authorities allowed this to happen and did not hold the same referendum there. The population of Lugansk and Donetsk began to resist because they did not want to be destroyed, and later proclaimed their regions as independent republics - LPR and DPR.\r  \n\r  \nMany volunteers from Russia began to fight on the side of the LPR and DPR (let's face it and honestly there were professional military men), hence the talk about Russian aggression. But I do not see anything aggressive and illegal in preventing the genocide of people. Volunteers from Serbia, France and even the United States also began to fight on the side of the LPR and DPR, but for some reason Ukraine has no claim to these countries.\r  \n\r  \nAs a result of the hostilities, the armies of the unrecognized republics managed to defeat the Ukrainian troops (Ilovaisky cauldron, battles near Debaltseve). This was followed by the Minsk Agreements.\r  \n\r  \nAnd now the army of Ukraine, pumped up by the West with money, weapons and equipment, is striving, contrary to the peace agreements, to return the territories of the unrecognized republics under its control. Naturally, all this will be accompanied by genocide of the local Russian population. Russia cannot allow this to happen for obvious reasons. Therefore, if Ukraine attacks the LPR and DPR, Russia reserves the right to DIRECTLY intervene in the conflict in order to protect the Russians in Ukraine. Until today, there has been no direct intervention of the Russian armed forces and there is no evidence of this.\r  \n\r  \nIf Ukraine does not violate the Minsk agreements and does not attack the LPR and DPR, Russia, in turn, will not attack either.",

If, for this sacred purpose, a local psychopathic king is entrusted with the key to starting World War III, the United States will. In this case, Ukraine is playing the role of a psychopathic king, whom the United States is ready to give carte blanche for any insanity - genocide, ethnic cleansing, cover them with its nuclear shield and call all this an unprecedented desire for democracy. Well, or they will call it something else, in general, you will eat it and be filled with anger towards Russia. Everything as usual"

People keep using arguments like “There can’t be nazis in Ukraine, they have a jewish president!” (Just to clarify - I am not arguing that there are Nazis in Ukraine. Just saying that this specific argument is used often, and yes, I don’t think that it is a relevant argument). In Russia nazism is more a shorthand for extreme nationalism, where you want to clear your country from certain ethnicities, so heck, you can be a Jewish Nazi (ask some Palestinians) \n\n2) It does seem that Europe considers Russia an acceptable target for that sort of thing. Again, I am not justifying the invasion etc, but Russian speakers/ethnic Russians (not the same thing, often similar troubles) HAVE been mistreated in Eastern Europe, and it seems to mostly turn a blind eye on it, or to think that people have some sort of “right” to it because - they need to get rid of Soviet legacy or something? Donetsk and Luhansk HAD legitimate concerns, but everyone just assumed that there were only Russian troops in disguise there, no actual people.

He says:\n\n* Ukraine will not be handed back its territory.\n* Ukraine will never join NATO.\n* The US will not be involved in sustaining a ceasefire.\n\n**This is BEFORE negotiations between Trump and Putin (that do not even involve Ukraine) have even taken place.**\n\nAny single one of these things is enough to guarantee that Ukraine's future existence is completely forfeit.\n\nAsk any honest and competent analyst and they will tell you the same thing: All that these policies can hope to achieve is to delay an even greater onslaught of Ukrainian people at a future date after Putin (or whatever despot that replaces him) has replenished their forces.\n\nThe war will not end - it will be deferred to the aggressor's advantage. Millions more lives will be lost, and this doesn't even include the other flare ups that will take place all over the world as a result of US isolationism and democratic splintering. This is the path that will lead us to World War III.\n\n**This is not a drill.**\n\nThe future of our world comes down to this:\n\nUkraine still has a chance to negotiate on its own terms and prevent a scenario that will lead to even greater catastrophe. It can only do this with the full support of Western (and in particular, European) allies. In order to get that support, politicians within those countries (for the most part) have to believe that it is in their own personal interest to provide unconditional support for Ukraine - the only way that those politicians will provide that support unconditionally, is if the voters of the nations and constituencies they represent make it abundantly clear that **Ukraine is Non-Negotiable**. It is absolutely imperative that the politician believes that his or her job is entirely dependent on both the commitment and follow-through of supporting Ukraine financially, humanitarian, and militarily.\n\n**We have to rally and demonstrate like the world depends upon it, because it does. We need to get as many people as possible attending demonstrations and contacting their political representatives so that the issue cannot be ignored.**\n\nWe do not have a lot of time. February 24th will mark 3 years since russia's full scale invasion - it is the natural time that politicians will look out for in order to gauge to what degree they might be forthcoming with the issue on the national and international stages. They will ask whether or not the people with the power to keep them in elected positions are still active in their support of the Ukrainian people or if they have forgotten about them.\n\nWe need all hands on deck to make this work. If you reading this right now, share this post and the poster we have provided on all available platforms. Check the website [https://standwithukraine.org/](https://standwithukraine.org/) to find out where the nearest demonstration event is to you. If there is no Pro-Ukrainian demonstration in your nearest major city, **Seriously Consider Making One** and adding it to the map provided on the website.\n\n* Translate the poster and this post if you are able to and share it to Non-English speaking communities on all available platforms - Reddit, Twitter, BlueSky, Instagram, Facebook, even TikTok (then get rid of TikTok).\n* Bug your favourite influencers until they repost or give a shoutout to the world-wide demonstrations.\n* **Comment on this post**, seriously, just do it. Comment on every post you see that tells people about the world wide demonstrations. Just straight up start conversations with people in the comment sections. Social Media algorithms are trained to prioritise engagement, brute-force hack that algorithm.\n* Find out who your local, regional, and national political representatives are and bug the living crap out of them. Make sure they get the message and don't quit until they've made a public statement committing to supporting Ukraine with political, humanitarian, and military aid - **whatever it takes**.\n\nDon't give up. There is too much riding on this for us to lose. If we do not act now, it will not only be ourselves who pay the price for our inaction, it will be our children, and their children, and their children's children, for countless generations to come. I cannot overstate this. The fight for Ukraine is the fight for the freedom of this world. The fate of that world will be determined by the events of the coming weeks.\n\n**Ukraine is non-negotiable.**\n\nMake sure our Ukrainian brothers and sisters know that we're still here. Remind them that they are not forgotten, and that they never will be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7p83bu29gje1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d97e2c68a31ea11c801dfebb103acf7f63eb254\n\n",

                "Good. I know this is probably mostly an emotional response and a way to put pressure on the west to allow them entry into NATO, but if NATO won't sack up and accept the country that is literally doing their job in terms of suppressing russian aggression in Europe, I fully support Ukraine firing up the reactors and developing their own nuclear arsenal. \n\nNever before in the history of the world has there ever been as justifiable a reason to produce nuclear weapons as a deterrent. This isn't a case of the Iranians wanting to make a nuke to kill all the jews, or NK wanting to keep their dear leader in power via a nuke program. This is an existential threat to a country that literally had a nuclear arsenal and gave them up the country that is literally invading them. The other signees on the contract, while UA is grateful for the aid, simply aren't doing enough to help AND are holding Ukraine back from defending itself. NATO won't give a clear pathway to membership. All but guaranteed russian stools like Hungary and Slovakia will vote against them. Germany is too busy quivering in fear in the corner. Other member states can't/won't/don't have the resources to help further.\n\nUkraine has been tossing the west lifeline after lifeline to prove they are worthy of being accepted into the west's club. They fight within the rules of war and with honor. They fight within the frame of the Geneva convention. They do all of this while their opponent does the complete opposite and without remorse. They do all this while aid is drip-fed to them and when they do get it, they are forced to adhere to western fears of escalation and watch their citizen die day after day by attacks that could be be stopped by simply telling them \"yes go ahead\". Don't think I have ever witnessed an entity fight back with such restraint and within such nonsense escalatory rules before and still have a fighting chance. \n\nSimply put, UA will do what is best for itself and better to ask forgiveness later then permission now. The west has had chance after chance after chance to nip the russian problem in the bud dating back to the 90s, and still thought it was wise to do business with them and extend them non-stop olive branches. That very clearly isn't working, hasn't worked, and never will work. Russians only understand the language of force (something the west has failed to learn) and Ukraine is the only one speaking that same language. The west is so afraid of russian redlines, but perhaps it's time they learn Ukrainian ones. Show them a pathway to membership, help them get there ASAP, or learn to have another nuclear state in Europe.\n\nThe west has no one else to blame but themselves that it has reached this stage.",

This is their fight, their future, and it needs to be conducted on their terms. russia or anyone else cannot be allowed to dictate terms.\n\namerica needs to be entirely sidelined from discussions if they don't want to help, and Europe needs to fully commit, none of this half-house bullshit.",
                "Of course no one should negotiate Ukraine’a position.\nThe solution is very simple. Dementia Don could’ve fulfilled his promise to end the war in 24 hours if Russia would just get the F out. Putin needs to be held accountable for all the death and destruction he has caused. And hell no, there should be no land given to Russia.\nThe entire world should give the weapons needed to Ukraine to just destroy Putin and Russia. End of story.",
                "And why would he? No one is negotiating with the best interests of Ukraine in mind. What is decided about Ukraine without Ukraine in the room is not anything done with Ukraine's consent.\n\nDoes everyone remember when Trump negotiated with the Taliban without included the Afghan government in the talks? How did that work out? Now imagine Trump's entire political career had already been strangely, suspiciously aligned with the best interests of the Taliban, as has been the case with Putin.\n\nThis isn't the United States negotiating with Russia to find the best settlement for Ukraine. This is Trump doing what Putin wants. Ukraine has no reason to respect any decisions made in these talks. In fact, they would be crazy to do so.",
                "Czechoslovakia was told to obey the will of the great powers in the fall of 1938 without even consulted. Taking over key military assets from Czech territory without a fight boosted Germany’s strength and paved the way for the assault on Poland (strongly aided by RuSSia) a year later.  \nEurope CAN & MUST support Ukraine’s just battle against the RuSSian yoke without any support from the American Quislings.",

However, one night they planned to steal something from a warehouse, but the plan failed and they got shot at. My grandpa and other resistance members had to flee while bullets flew around him. Hans was around 5 meters away from him, but he got hit and died.\n\nGrandpa always asked the question \"why he, and not me\" he always tells us that not the best survive war, but the lucky ones. However he also told us that if he wasn't lucky, and he got killed instead of Hans, he would've gladly have died so Hans could raise his children in freedom instead of him. Hans believed in a free Netherlands, and an environment where they could live in freedom.\n\nNow Grandpa is 100, but he says he simply choose not to die yet cuz he still doesn't know what to tell Hans (and other resistance buddies) in heaven. But if he decided what to tell him, he will be dead. So if we find him dead in his sleep, he decided what to tell Hans.\n\nNot sure if this story helps you, but you have to move forward and carry on cuz your husband died because he believed your son should be raised in freedom, you should live in freedom, and the children of his warbuddies should live in freedom. He died because he believed in both you and a free Ukraine. Always move forward not for your own sake, but because he believes in you even in heaven. And he probably wants you to turn old before you can come to him in heaven.\n\nIf you have questions or want to know details you can always DM me. I visit grandpa this weekend, so if you want I can ask him a question for you."

                "Simply put, JD Vance is most anti-Ukrainian Senator in the US. Aside from his 100% anti-Ukrainian voting record, he goes above and beyond to promote Russian narratives: Ukraine cannot win, Ukraine should cede land to end the war, Ukraine is corrupt and the US is writing it blank checks. He went as far as repeating the fake story about Zelensky's yacht, and published[ this op-ed in the NYT against continuing to support Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/opinion/jd-vance-ukraine.html). I've had a personal interaction with a Senator's aide who told me a disturbing story about JD Vance laughing during a meeting about Ukraine.\n\nI know there are still some who consider that Trump might be an improvement over Biden. I know your arguments well and have written before about why I find this unlikely. Choosing JD Vance as VP makes this prospect even more remote. JD Vance was selected for his [unwavering loyalty to Trump](https://snyder.substack.com/p/trump-seeks-vice), and their shared desire to [remake the American government](https://twitter.com/AccountableGOP/status/1812940196062642365) after seizing power.\n\nHowever, JD Vance is smarter, younger and more ideological than Trump. Vance's worldview and goals are inspired by the writings of [Curtis Yarvin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin) You can read Yarvin's views on Ukraine [here](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/a-clarification-on-ukraine) and [here](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/ukraine-the-tomb-of-liberal-nationalism) - it should make where Vance is coming from a lot clearer.\n\nI urge those not indifferent to both America's and Ukraine's future to vote accordingly and talk to those around you. If you have not read Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny, it's short, and is essentially a manual for what to do as government moves towards authoritarianism.",

He flew there through Protect a Volunteer and then one our own volunteers helped him get protective equipment.\n\nToday a good friend of Brock's messaged me. That friend is still on the front line and the team has taken heavy casualties. He told me that Chippy was  \"a fucking good soldier and a really good friend.\" I think he said all that needs to be said.\n\nIf you would like to help remember Chippy, this is a fundraiser for his funeral costs. His friend serving with him in the 2nd Battalion verified to me that this is real and is helping his family.\n\n[https://www.gofundme.com/f/wvhdc-brock-greenwood?attribution\\_id=sl:ba97f53e-3708-46fd-8806-c75d157bf303&utm\\_campaign=man\\_sharesheet\\_dash&utm\\_medium=customer&utm\\_source=facebook](https://www.gofundme.com/f/wvhdc-brock-greenwood?attribution_id=sl:ba97f53e-3708-46fd-8806-c75d157bf303&utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_dash&utm_medium=customer&utm_source=facebook)\n\nWe also have many soldiers in the 2nd Battalion in need of help.

Never forgotten.",

We would talk frequently almost everyday for up to four years playing Dota 2 and talking about things in the fantasy genre. Bantering about how awful the final season of Game of Thrones was, about the innacuracies of the Nilfgaardian armour in the Witcher Netflix series. He was also writing a fantasy book, he would often come to me to share his ideas and ask for mine since I was just worldbuilding for the fun of it.\n\n\nOur communications drifted after he joined the war, and after a while his absence was felt in my life so I tried reaching out to him. A few days before he died we played our final game of Dota 2 together. It was almost unplayable on 280 ping but I still had fun catching up with him. I'll cherish that final game of closure.\n\n\nDevastating to know that we will never hear any new fantastical ideas he comes up with again, our plans to meet in person forever gone and never having my Crusader MMR midlaner partner in my ranked games again...\n\n\nRest well FFF."

Luckily I was not in country at the time when the invasions started, and obviously do not plan on going back any time soon.\n\nSo I was hanging out with friends earlier and got a call from one of these relatives in Ukraine. It was just a normal call, we have them often just to check up. After the call my friends asked who it was, and I said that it was my baba who has been staying at a refugee camp in Germany because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAfter telling them this one of my friends looked at me with a straight face and asked\n\n\"Oh, that's still going on?\"\n\nI love the guy and he didn't mean anything bad by it but my god that left me speechless.\n\nAnyways that gets to the core of my question, is this something happening to the collective of the world, or was this just a rare case of ignorance? It honestly really concerns me.\n\nTLDR; Friend didn't know Ukraine was still under attack, is this happening on a wider scale?",

We need to observe what the North Korean military is doing. The Ukraine war is a representative example of what future wars might look like, so the idea that ‘we shouldn’t go near Ukraine or provide ammunition’ is wrong.”\n\nIn response, Heo Young, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party of Korea, countered, “Just because North Korea sends troops and weapons to Ukraine, it doesn’t mean we should engage in the same behavior by sending observers and weapons. That would severely endanger our nation and its people. The military must prioritize the interests of the nation and the people, responding cool-headedly and decisively but with caution.”",

                "I do think that once russia uses those missiles from Iran, US will allow Ukraine to use long range missiles in russia same way they did with HIMARS use outside ukraine to defend kharkiv (by not publicizing it and only acknowledging it after it has done damage).\n\n1) reason why I think this is going through happen, is because the US has been increasingly being vague about their responses. They’re still indicating “not allowed” but not directly stating not allowed like before. \n\n2) The US do not want to incentivize Iran and North Korea sending missiles to Russia. drones are already an escalation but missiles are a different story. It paints the image of US being a bad ally to have, when other countries are freely using their exported missiles and the US is still tying Ukraine’s hands while being invaded. \nKeep in mind the revenue Iran and North Korea gets from those funds regional instability (Middle East and Korean peninsula) so it’s in the US’s best interest to deter this.\n\n3) Ukraine has explicitly stated they WILL attack Iran if these iranian missiles kill even one Ukrainian civilian. US will allow Ukraine to use long range missiles in russia against specific targets with the caveat that ukraine doesn’t attack iran to prevent a broader ukraine-iran war. \n\n4) Increasing pressure from NATO countries to lift the restrictions. Most recently within the past two weeks, the following countries have expressed that any weapons they send can be used to hit military targets anywhere in russia:  netherlands, latvia, estonia and others all with statements that urge the US to lift restrictions on long range missiles. \nMost notably, france and the UK have also been pushing US to lift the restrictions on long range missile use.\n\n5) russia moved 90% of their fighter jets outside atacms range. russia either had intelligence of ukraine being able to use western long range missiles soon or had good indicators of this move \n\n6)Still not hopeful and maybe im delulu lol",

                "Well, that's a pretty distressing,  depressing  read. But the popular headline is \"Ukraine gets F-16\" without getting into the details.",
                "Article Summary: Ukraine’s long-awaited F-16s have arrived, but significant limitations may hinder their effectiveness. The aircraft, sourced from Denmark and the Netherlands, are older models equipped with outdated AN/APG-66 radars and stripped of Link 16 communication systems—severely limiting their air-to-air capabilities.\n\nPoint #1 – Without Link 16, Ukraine’s F-16s can’t fire long-range missiles like the AIM-120 or AGM-158 JASSM, leaving them at a significant disadvantage against Russian fighters and bombers.\n\nPoint #2 – While these jets can still assist in downing drones and cruise missiles, experts question whether they can meaningfully shift the balance in Ukraine’s favor without urgent upgrades and additional Western support.\n\nUkraine’s F-16s Arrive—But Are They Too Outdated to Make an Impact?\n\nUkraine only received its first F-16 fighter aircraft—used models sent from Denmark—in August 2024.\n\nThis was almost two years after the first meetings between the Ukrainian (PSU), Polish (SP), and US Air Forces on the possibility of Kyiv receiving and operating these aircraft.\n\n“This is a very long cycle to deliver aircraft that are used and about to be retired and supposedly that the donor nations were looking for ways to divest themselves of anyway,” said an official from one of the Ukrainian firms that is working with the PSU on supporting the aircraft now that they are in service.\n\nThis week, it was reported that Ukraine received additional F-16s, this time more used aircraft from the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF).\n\nWhen asked if having more F-16s would help the Ukraine Armed Forces, a senior official, to whom 19FortyFive spoke, stated, “More aircraft are always a help, but the issue is which missions can they carry out effectively.”\n\n\n\nThis was almost two years after the first meetings between the Ukrainian (PSU), Polish (SP), and US Air Forces on the possibility of Kyiv receiving and operating these aircraft.\n\n“This is a very long cycle to deliver aircraft that are used and about to be retired and supposedly that the donor nations were looking for ways to divest themselves of anyway,” said an official from one of the Ukrainian firms that is working with the PSU on supporting the aircraft now that they are in service.\n\nThis week, it was reported that Ukraine received additional F-16s, this time more used aircraft from the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF).\n\nWhen asked if having more F-16s would help the Ukraine Armed Forces, a senior official, to whom 19FortyFive spoke, stated, “More aircraft are always a help, but the issue is which missions can they carry out effectively.”\n\nThe F-16 has been marketed for years as a premier multi-role fighter that can perform all missions for all countries in all theaters of operation. “Buy an aircraft – get an air force” has been the long-standing Lockheed Martin (LM) marketing slogan used for years to convince any potential customer nation that this aircraft is the best acquisition decision, as well as value for money possible.\n\nObstacles and Limitations\n\nSpeaking recently with some of the senior Ukrainian support engineering staff working with the F-16s reveals significant problems that just sending more aircraft does not address.\n\nOne is that the F-16s delivered to Ukraine are older model F-16s, which are equipped with the mechanically-steered array (MSA) AN/APG-66(V)2 radar, an older model that was superseded in later model F-16s by the AN/APG-68 series. The latest models of the F-16s sold with the latter radar are equipped with the (V)9 model.\n\nA Ukrainian engineer who spoke with 19FortyFive explained, “This is a radar that is less capable even than the versions of the MiG-29’s N019 radar that have been upgraded by our industry. So, it is hard to do much with these aircraft considering what the Russians are putting up against us.”\n\nMaking matters worse, he continued, is “all of the aircraft sent to Ukraine thus far have had their Link 16 hardware removed. Without this, the effective ranges at which we are able to engage Russian aircraft is about one-third of the range at which their fighter aircraft can fire on us.”\n\n“This effectively makes it impossible for us to use the F-16 for an air-to-air mission,” he said. “The best we can do is to employ the aircraft in trying to use short-range missiles to shoot down Russian drones or air-launched cruise missiles and glide bombs.”\n\nA potential solution the Ukrainians developed was to “integrate the US-made AIM-9X onto the MiG-29,” said another defense electronics engineer 19FortyFive spoke with. “But when the people from Raytheon (the missile’s manufacturer) found out about this they started peppering us with questions about who gave us permission to use their missile on our aircraft.”\n\n“Can you imagine,” he said. “We are in the middle of a war and our cities are being bombed into rubble and these Raytheon people are asking us where did we get permission.”\n\nWithout Link 16, not only are the aircraft unable to fire longer-range air-to-air missiles, which could permit them to take out Russian bomber aircraft before they launch their cruise missiles at Ukrainian cities.\n\nThey are also unable to fire the long-range US AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) that could take out Russian bombers while they are still at their bases on the ground.\n\nConfigurations of F-16\n\nMost of the aircraft supplied to Ukraine thus far are older-model F-16s equipped with similar Pratt & Whitney F100 engine models. For now, they are working with the same powerplant on each aircraft.\n\n“If we end up with some of the more advanced model F-16s – the C/D series,” said a Ukrainian support engineer, “that could make using these aircraft even more complicated. We would love to have more aircraft, we would love to have the higher thrust [GE] engine, but we will need more support for the training of our ground crews and more maintenance equipment as well.”",
                "Link16 is NATO-only functionality. None of non-NATO countries operating F-16 has access to it. \n\nI think calling donated jets “stripped of” is disingenuous. You never hear Israel, UAE, or South Korea (all close nato allies) complaining about lack of it, since it was generally understood when those countries purchased their f-16 that them being non-NATO, won’t have NATO-only capabilities.\n\nI know there have been some talks within NATO about providing this capability to Ukraine, as an exception, but this is very delicate process.",
                "From a bit of a look at this \"19fortyfive\" site, it seems a bit garbage, [with headline articles by far-right libertarian types](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/02/why-the-ukraine-war-may-never-end/) about how Ukraine can't possibly win, and how mean the West was towards Putin's totally reasonable demands, and with links to even more far-right sites that talk about how great DOGE is and what-not. So I'd take anything from there with a grain of salt.",
                "US and Europe said not to expect miracles from F16s because they would be older models.\n\nReddit threw tantrums crying that F16s were the gigachad of planes that would dominate the sky and make russia surrender instantly and should be given right away without training because Ukrainian pilots would magically be able to fly them.\n\nThe planes show up and have exactly the capabilities their former owners said they would have.  Also, the pilots say the transition from soviet-design shit to western avionics is really difficult.\n\nReddit blames Biden for not meeting their made-up expectations.\n\nTypical.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian leadership and armed forces knew exactly what they were getting with these planes.  The only people disappointed are internet keyboard warriors."

She is Ukrainian. She is a woman. She is a mother.\n\n\nShe is losing herself as she can’t find an employer despite being hideously well educated, erudite and capable. Cleaning jobs aplenty…. Below minimum wage cash jobs aplenty. She’s done both to survive.\n\n\nDoesn’t she deserve more? Shouldn’t we all forget our day to day crap and think there by the grace of god go I. Shouldn’t we do more for the Ukrainians and other refugees that our in our country than latch on to media soundbites and negativity and remember they are people like us who were just living life until Putin came to call.\n\nGlobal escalation of this war is coming and Svetlana is our sister as are all refugees.\n\nDO MORE PEOPLE.",

We need to make sure Ukraine has what is necessary for as long as necessary, because we cannot allow Putin to win this war,” the prime minister said.\n\nRussia, however, accused the west of escalation and said that Biden risked adding “fuel to the fire” in Ukraine, and while Donald Trump remained silent on the issue, his son Don Jr accused the military industrial complex of wanting to get “world war three going”.\n\nStorm Shadow missiles have a range of about 250km, similar to the US Atacms, and have in the past been given to Kyiv by the UK and France to strike targets inside Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders.\n\nBut the US retained an effective veto on their use because it supplies a guidance system and repeated lobbying by the UK had failed to shift the US position, which has only begun to soften after the election victory of Donald Trump earlier this month.",

We're in this one way or another whether we'd like to be or not, and not investing now will cost us more in money and lives later. In the highly probable event of another Trump presidency, Putin may be tempted to take his chance with another country less well equipped, like Moldova or revisiting Georgia. And if that works, and if Trump looks like he'll let him get away with it, and if he continues to be fed what he wants to hear by his own intelligence services, he might try the same with a NATO country (especially if Trump pulls the US out of NATO). That sounds insane but Putin is not known for his rational nature at this point. Best to wear them down now rather than having to face them ourselves later.\n\nEven from a purely economic point of view, the cost in raised food prices from a full occupation of Ukraine alone would be more to the British public than the taxes spent on arms to prevent that."

                "There are plenty of other factors:\n\n- Proximity. People care more about things happening on their doorstep than things happening on the other side of the world.\n\n- Frequency. Major land wars in Europe are extremely unusual and don’t happen very often (arguably the last major land war in Europe was the Second World War). On the other hand, wars in places like the Middle East and Africa are common, so don’t get as much news coverage (news is supposed to be _new_)\n\n- Social media. The Ukraine conflict is all over social media, and theres so much footage that we’re pretty much watching it happen live. This is not the case for many conflicts in poorer countries where fewer people use social media and have smartphones (although there are plenty of youtube videos). \n\n- The speed of the deterioration. Ukraine has gone from being a middle income country to a warzone in only a couple of days. \n\n- The overwhelming numbers of the Russian army. People love “David vs Goliath” stories. \n\n- The nuclear factor. Although extremely unlikely, there is a very small chance this could end with most of the planet becoming radioactive.\n\n- Demographics. Ukraine has stopped all their fighting age men from leaving, prioritising the evacuation of women and children. On the other hand, refugees from the middle east and Africa have been mostly young men. This has raised a couple of eyebrows as to whether they are in fact economic migrants, as economic migrants tend to be mostly young-middle aged men, but one would expect refugees to either contain a spread of ages and even mix of genders, or mainly be women and children. \n\nThere are many more factors, but putting it all down to racism is too simplistic (and often an attempt to smear those who care about the war in Ukraine). It’s also unreasonable to expect everyone to care equally about everything.\n\nEdit: And many people _did_ care about these other wars- for example, the war in Iraq triggered some of the largest protests in modern history.",

                "> Elbridge Colby told The Telegraph that the UK should not expect significant support from the US on Ukraine under a second Trump administration, and called for Europe to take “primary responsibility” for the war.    \n>    \n> He suggested Britain should deploy a “Britain first” approach to defence and security.    \n\nThe political stupidity of this attitude never ceases to amaze me. There is a reason that Europe continues to rely so heavily on the US for defence, and that reason is that historically US administrations have **wanted** us to. American foreign policy is the default western foreign policy, and that privileged position is bought largely through the outsourcing of defence matters to the US - that doesn't just include physical defence of Europe but also the ability to project force abroad to influence events around the world. They're the ones who can affect things, so they're the ones who get to decide in what manner things should be affected. \n\nThe corollary to a resurge in European defence spending is that Europe's going to be significantly less willing to toe the US line when it comes to making foreign and defence policy decisions, and I don't think that that's fully appreciated by those advocating it in the states.\n\nAll that said though, in principle from a UK point of view I think that that's fine in the long term. I think if Europe rebuilds both its military and defence-industrial capabilities to the point that we can guarantee our own security at home and abroad then so much the better. I don't think that necessarily includes abandoning the Indo-Pacific - there's some areas we should still be involved, particularly the industrial and technological cooperation with Australia and Japan - but if they want us to focus forces in the Atlantic and Europe - fine.",

Meaning if he escapes to Moldova and I meet him there, we'll have to apply for visa and wait for months in a country we have no connection to for a decision that might be negative.\n\nThe money is a concern, but it could be borrowed; I'm mostly worried about all that long waiting for the decision.\n\nIn any case, could someone confirm my understanding is correct and applying for a family visa seems to be our only option? \n\nIf that's correct, is there any way to try and influence the government to further relax the rules in a more meaningful way?\n\nPlease pardon my English. I'm a confident and fluent speaker of English, but it's not my native language.\n\nAlso, I know immigration is a controversial topic, but could you please try and avoid saying any mean things to me, cause the life is stressful enough even without being abused on reddit for bringing up controversial issues.",

I’m also sorry that you’ve had to ask for no hate on this post. We are lucky to have you here in the U.K. \n\nUnfortunately, I think you are correct on the visas. There is a lot of backlash and uproar about it and there are petitions etc you can sign (I’m not allowed to post those in here, but if a petition gets to 100k, the government have to legally acknowledge and debate it in parliament). There are marches etc too if you want to make your voice heard though with the government we have, I doubt it will do anything I’m afraid. \n\nSaying that, if you are a U.K. citizen, so is your son? Do what you have to do to get him here even if it’s a holiday visa. I think they’ve said they are prioritising Ukrainian visas so maybe he can come here on a holiday visa until his actual long term one gets sorted.",

                "Germany was accused of a “flagrant abuse of intelligence” after revealing that British soldiers are supporting Ukrainian forces launching long-range Storm Shadow missiles.\n\nOlaf Scholz said on Monday that he would not deliver the Taurus, Berlin’s equivalent of the Storm Shadow, as it would require soldiers assisting on the ground, citing the UK and French approach with their own systems. Mr Scholz argued that following the UK would make Germany a “participant in the war”.\n\nThe comments were seen as endangering British military and diplomatic personnel on the ground.\n\nTobias Ellwood, the former chairman of the Commons defence committee, said: “This is a flagrant abuse of intelligence deliberately designed to distract from Germany’s reluctance to arm Ukraine with its own long-range missile system. This will no doubt be used by Russia to racket up the escalator ladder.”\n\nMr Scholz was also criticised by German opposition MPs.\n\n“The chancellor’s statement regarding France and Britain’s alleged involvement in operating long-range cruise missiles used in Ukraine is completely irresponsible,” Norbert Rottgen, a senior MP from Angela Merkel’s former ruling party, the CDU.\n\nMr Scholz is under mounting pressure to deliver the long-range missile to disrupt Russia’s supply lines and prevent Moscow taking further territory.\n\nHe said on Monday that German soldiers could not follow their British and French peers in “the way of target control and accompanying target control”. The Storm Shadow is co-produced by the UK and France.",

Almost certain that there will be active duty special forces and spooks engaged in actual combat operations in Ukraine too but thats going to be at the highest level of secrecy. We members of the public certainly wont know the details for decades. \n\nI imagine the soldiers talked about in the article are probably in the west of the country where its safer but I was thinking what would happen if the Russkies sent a missle at a Ukrainian base and it ended up killing British soldiers that were there?  Of course there would be an escalation but AFAIK according to the laws of war it would still be a legal and legitimate target.",

                "\n\nThe British Army will on Tuesday warn soldiers not to travel to Ukraine to take up arms as it risks triggering a major escalation in the conflict.\n\nThe cautionary order comes after Downing Street rebuked Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, who said she \"absolutely\" supported British nationals fighting against the Russian invasion.\n\nIn a daily message to every soldier, seen by The Telegraph, known as a Part 1 Order, Sir Chris Tickell, the second in command of the army, will say on Tuesday: \"There has been some recent media coverage relating to foreigners being welcomed into Ukraine to help fight against Russia.\n\n\"To be clear, as members of the British Army, you are not authorised to travel to Ukraine to support the ongoing conflict against Russia in any form, whether you are on leave or not. Please remain professional and focused on your duty and your team.\"\n\nThe Telegraph understands the Army fears that soldiers seen with British insignia in Ukraine could trigger a major escalation in the conflict.\n\nCommanders were last night warned of \"rumblings through back channels of some soldiers considering [going to Ukraine]\".\n\nThe internal memo said that not only would this be \"very bad from a reputational and presentational point of view\", but \"more worryingly, at its worst, it could lead to miscalculation, which we need to guard against.\"\n\nBritain has vowed not to send troops to Ukraine and any deployment, even if unofficial, risks provoking retaliation from Russia and widening the conflict. \n\nIt came as Downing Street knocked down the Foreign Secretary amid warnings that British nationals might be breaking the law if they travel to fight in Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s official spokesman insisted on Monday that he “fully recognises the strength of feeling” among Britons who want to help, but reiterated the Government's advice not to travel to Ukraine.\n\nBen Wallace, the Defence Secretary, also urged Britons not to join the fighting, saying that the \"very dangerous\" situation could lead to them being killed.\n\nA Foreign Office source admitted that there could be legal consequences for Britons who travel to Ukraine to fight against the Russians.\n\n“It is legally murky”, the source said, adding those who go out to Ukraine to fight “do so at their own risk, legally or otherwise”.\n\nThe Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 makes it illegal for a British citizen to fight in a war involving a nation state which is at peace with the UK. But experts say that in practice this piece of legislation is not always applied and is unlikely to be in the case of Ukraine.\n\nEd Arnold, research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute, said the nineteenth century law was “not particularly enforced” when thousands of Britons went to join the Spanish civil war in the 1930s, nor is it currently enforced against dual nationals who are conscripted to fight in foreign armies such as the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\n**Foreign legionnaires: Veterans buy kit at Army surplus stores en route to Ukraine**\n\nThey are heading to Ukraine with years of experience under their belts. But first they need to buy a belt. And fatigues. And a flak jacket.\n\nHundreds of Britons with military experience are believed to be readying to enter Ukraine as part of the country’s new army of foreign legionnaires to bolster the fight against Russian troops that invaded last week. Among them are at least 20 veterans of special forces operations.\n\nFew of them still have their own kit, however, prompting last-minute shopping trips to army surplus stores.\n\nAt Folkestone’s G4 Echelon Military Supplies, owner Damon Warren - a 52-year-old ex-soldier - is giving a 50 per cent discount to both Ukrainians and any British veterans seeking to help them. Ever since the invasion began, Mr Warren said his phone had been ringing incessantly.\n\nAmong the callers is Andrew Lester, a 25-year-old electrician from Kent who served in the Parachute Regiment till last July, reaching the rank of lance corporal. Mr Lester has his own boots, but he needs a helmet, body armour, and gear for cold and wet conditions.\n\n“The Ukrainians are really doing quite well, I think,” he said. “They’re holding out. If they need a few more blokes to push them” – the Russians – “back, then that’s what we’re here for.”\n\nMr Lester said he knew of more than 100 former soldiers who were also planning to join the fight against Vladimir Putin’s “outrageous” invasion: “If it was the UK, I’d like help from other countries. So why not, eh?”\n\nUkrainian civilians might not have experience of handling military equipment, Mr Lester added, meaning that the expertise of British veterans could be of assistance.\n\nOwner Mr Warren said he had been turning away Britons who were not veterans because those with neither military experience nor the ability to speak Ukrainian would be “more of a liability than a help.”\n\nSome of Mr Lester’s colleagues in the group of ex-Paras hoping to fight for Ukraine are veterans of special forces missions. They include Dave Radband, 36, who was part of special forces missions in Afghanistan and Iraq and now is the director of a railway engineering company.\n\n“When you’ve got 10 tours under your belt, you’ve got a unique skillset,” Mr Radband said. “You can’t just sit around. It comes down to morals. You can’t just sit around and let this happen. They need our help, so we’ll go out and help them.”\n\nHundreds of veterans were making similar plans, Mr Radband added. Of the 30-strong group of which he and Mr Lester are a part, Mr Radband estimated that 20 had been in the Special Forces Support Group.\n\nThey had felt a call to action, Mr Radband said. “We don’t fight for ourselves. We’re protectors.”\n\nThe Folkestone store has also received hundreds of orders of kit from Ukrainians making purchases either for themselves or for their countrymen.\n\n\n\nMr Warren spent Monday at his depot handing over thousands of pieces of kit, the vast majority of which is going to Ukrainians. Four were loading boxes with uniforms when The Telegraph visited, stripping off badges bearing the Union flag under instruction from Mr Warren.\n\nMr Warren said he was making no profit from the kit he was selling. “I’ve been to war zones and I’ve seen what it does. So my heart is with the Ukrainians, and my heart is telling me to help them as best I can.”\n\nTwo of the shop’s Ukrainian customers were a pair of brothers: Andriy Batuk, 39, and Roman Svisun, 46. The brothers, each of whom has lived in the UK for several years, were buying kit that they and a friend were about to drive to the Ukrainian border, before returning to do the same thing again.\n\nThey might end up having to fight, said Mr Batuk. For the time being, they had to hurry off to the continent, laden with gear. “We have to do it, otherwise he” – Vladimir Putin – “will destroy us. We will disappear as a nation.”",

If someone was attacking England or someone was attacking my wife or my son, I would take a gun and go and fight,” he told The Independent.\n\n“This is not the place for me to fight. I’m not going to get a gun and start shooting.”\n\nThe father added: “I hate what Russia is doing at the moment. I’m definitely against the war and the war that Putin is doing. But I just want to come back home and see my family.”\n\nThe Independent has set up a petition calling on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to those in Ukraine. To sign the petition click here.\n\nRussia launched an attack on Ukraine by sea, air and land on Thursday after the threat had loomed for weeks. Since then, rocket strikes have fallen on cities and heavy fighting has taken place across the country.\n\nIn the first four days of the attack, Ukraine’s health ministry said more than 350 civilians - including 14 children - were killed.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations estimated half a million people have fled across the border so far.\n\nMr Chumak was not one of them. He has tried to cross three times - but was turned back each one.\n\nThe 39-year-old said border officials told him: “You shouldn’t be here. You should be up front fighting for your homeland.”\n\nThe UK resident, who works in a hotel in London, said he tried to explain that even though he had a Ukranian passport, he did not live there and his wife and son were in England. “My life is elsewhere.”\n\n“It is just a broad rule that all the men, regardless of the situation, are not allowed to cross the border. The scenes at the border when all the men been parted from their families, like wives and children ... it has been horrific,” he said.\n\nHe spent three nights at the border trying to cross, during which time more and more people started turning up. Temperatures were about 5C and people would have to queue for several hours to use a petrol station toilet.\n\n“The food started running out at the border,” he told The Independent. “I saw the body of a woman who literally died at the petrol station.”\n\nMr Chumak said he could not get any medicine when he started to fall ill - and ended up returning back to his parents’ home several hours inland to recover.\n\nHe will wait there and try and find a way to come back home to London “at the first opportunity”.\n\n“It is just not my place to fight,” the father-of-one said.\n\nHis British wife, Nicola O’Donnell, told The Independent, she had been in touch with embassies and the Foreign Office to try and get her husband - who has indefinite leave to remain in the UK - back home, but had not had any luck so far.\n\n“Everybody’s says he’s not British, there’s nothing we can do. They were not very helpful,” the 47-year-old, who met her husband while they were both working in Pizza Hut in Kensington, said.\n\nShe is now trying to stay positive for their 12-year-old son, who says he wants to “make his dad proud” in his football games. Mr Chumak manages his son’s football team.\n\nThe Foreign Office declined to comment. The British Embassy in Ukraine has been approached for comment.",

He's scared to die, and scared to be put in a position where he might have to make the choice to kill someone. Not being on the front line is no guarantee of safety, especially when Russia has been bombing children's hospitals and orphanages. That's a very understandable and human feeling to have.\n\nAnd he has a family, with a 12 year old son. The thought that he doesn't want to leave his son without a father has probably gone through his mind, and I can't blame him for that either. I deeply admire the courage of the people who have signed up to fight but I sympathise with this guy too, and I just can't find it in me to blame him for wanting to stay safe and go home to his family."

                ">Starmer has yet to visit Ukraine four months after taking office, and a senior figure in Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government voiced frustration on Friday over Britain’s failure to supply Ukraine with additional long-range missiles.\n>\n>The Kyiv official told the Guardian: “It isn’t happening, Starmer isn’t giving us long-range weapons. The situation is not the same as when Rishi Sunak was prime minister. The relationship has got worse.”\n\nMeanwhile a Trump spokesman today said Ukraine will have to give up Crimea in return for a peace deal. Like it or not, that sounds realistic. This war has dragged on nearly three years (or ten if you go back to 2014's annexation of Crimea) and there is absolutely no path to total victory for Ukraine and the recovery of all its lost territory.\n\n>Bryan Lanza, a strategist who worked on Trump's recent presidential campaign, told the BBC the incoming administration would ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his version of a \"realistic vision for peace\".\n>\n>\"And if President Zelensky comes to the table and says, well we can only have peace if we have Crimea, he shows to us that he's not serious,\" he said. \"Crimea is gone.\"\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxrwr078v7o\n\nedit - supposedly Trump is disavowing the above now. So who knows.\n\n>Donald Trump's presidential transition effort says a Republican operative who outlined some potential contours of a US-backed peace plan in Ukraine earlier in the day was not speaking on behalf of the president-elect.\n>\n>Responding to Mr Lanza's comments, a spokesperson for the transition denied that Mr Lanza — who was on Trump's transition team after the 2016 election — spoke for Trump. \n>\n>\"Bryan Lanza was a contractor for the campaign,\" said the spokesperson, who declined to be named.\n>\n>\"He does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him.\"\n\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-10/trump-team-distances-itself-from-replublican-ukraine-peace-plan/104582654",
                "Just continued Tory lies as always. There is near certainty the policy on Ukraine would be no different whatsoever. But the reality is neither party is willing to do what’s necessary for a Ukrainian victory, and now that Trump is in power Ukraine is doomed unless there is a major increase in manpower, ammunition and repair efficiency, something Russia has a major advantage over Ukraine.\n\nI think people that say he will agree to peace when he gets the 5 Oblasts he claims (Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea) are incredibly optimistic. The reality is that Putin knows his forces can achieve much more than that under a Trump presidency by just fighting. Expect him to ask for Sumy, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv and who knows what else. \n\nIf NATO membership or at the very least a peace keeping force is not agreed, then expect Ukraine to become a Russian puppet state.",
                "Absolute nonsense. Labour have been in for 150 days and it’s the same policy.\n\nIt’s all but ended under trump who is stating openly that Russia owns Crimea and asking Ukraine to recognise their land grab as a peace deal.\n\nWallace is an embarrassment"

Corbyn's position is too simplistic, he is mistaken that providing weaponry will neccessarily prolong the war. Failing to provide adequate support to Ukraine could indeed result in a shorter war, but with Russian gains which would represent an increased threat to neighbouring countries and to the West. Corbyn is right in that much more effort must be put into the negotiation for peace, although it will be incredibly difficult to negotiate with Russia while Putin remains in power. It's not an either-or question; to shorten the war, increased efforts for peace must be simultaneously backed up by increased defensive capabilities. \n\nHaving said this, I think Corbyn is playing an important role, there must be somebody calling for negotiations otherwise our national postition would be purely militaristic, placing us in diametric oppostion to Russia and negating our role in the possibility for progress in any peace talks. As he has done in the past, he is placing himself in the difficult position of interlocutor, and as such will recieve a great deal of criticism as a 'sympathiser' which is clearly baseless.",

Instead, UK will simply issue a bond secured by the russian assets.\n\nSo when UK transfers this bond to Ukraine, it will create a debt that Ukraine will have to repay the UK, presumably with interest.\n\nNow let's assume that some time in the future, russia finally decides (or is forced) to F off from all occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Ukrainian territorial integrity is restored, the war is won. What happens next? Sanctions come down, all the russian assets in the UK become unfrozen.\n\nNow UK owes russia interest on all these years russian money has been in UK banks. And in turn, Ukraine owes the UK interest on bonds secured against this money.\n\nSo in a sense, Ukraine will become indebted to russia by proxy of UK. Instead of the proper way of russia having to pay Ukraine reparations for all the destruction they caused. No, paying money to russia after winning war against them does not sound like a good idea.\n\nI hope this is just me completely misunderstanding the mechanism Cameron is proposing, and in reality we won't be paying interest to UK which will then go to russia.",

NHS waiting list was 2 years, so I signed up privately. Anyway, fast forward to the other day:\n\nMe: Hi, I’ve got a 10-month-old who has got 4 teeth now. Can I pop him onto your NHS waiting list?\n\nReceptionist: We don’t have one. The list is too long so we’re not putting anyone else on it.\n\nMe: Ah damn. What are your private fees like for babies/children? Can I just sign him up privately then?\n\nReceptionist: Are you with us already?\n\nMe: Yep. [do the surname/address check etc]\n\nReceptionist: Ok. That’s fine. I can sign him up on the NHS if you like?\n\nMe: …yes, please…",

                "I couldn't go to the dentist during lockdown, because... It was a lockdown. So because I hadn't been in 18months I was removed from the list.\n\nObviously my filling decided it was a great time to fall out, tried to sign up with other dentists taking NHS. Nope. Best I can get is a 110 mile round journey with an appointment pencilled in for May 2023.",

If it wanted to intervene militarily, it would do so as part of a coalition with allies. This is the same for the US, France, Germany and other Western powers. \n\nIf a Western coalition did intervene, UK forces would probably be used to reinforce certain parts of Ukraine. \n\nThe British Armed Forces may be small but the capabilities they bring to the table are still considerable. UK strengths would be its regular infantry, special forces, a carrier strike group, potent submarines, Typhoons, cyber capabilities. It’s main weakness would be it’s armour which wouldn’t look amiss on the Antiques Roadshow these days.\n\nAlso, whilst the UK’s response so far has been called “weak”, the UK has been a lot more hawkish against Russia and in its support for Ukraine than both France and Germany."

He survived the attack, which has been linked to the New IRA.\nSources told the Belfast Telegraph that the grenades found on Thursday were of a newer type used by the Russian army.\nMore and more weapons from the war in Ukraine were getting into the hands of criminal and paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, they said.\nAbout 20,000 mercenaries from around the world travelled to fight with the Ukrainian army at the start of the war.\nThere has been an increase in stolen weaponry as many soldiers-for-hire left as the fighting intensified.\n\n> “Not only was the intention here to kill and maim, but there is a total disregard for the wider community,” said Mr McEwan on Friday. \n“These items were being stored in a residential area, in close proximity to a children’s play area,” he added, before describing the find as “extremely worrying” for the community and officers.\n“Be assured that the success of this recovery demonstrates our dedication to pursuing these groups, the professionalism of our teams and our dogged determination to bring these people before the courts.”\nLast month, the PSNI announced a huge data breach had led to details of almost 10,000 officers and staff.\nThe data has fallen into the hands of dissident republicans, which heightened security fears and contributed to the resignation of Chief Constable Simon Byrne last week.",

Don’t think I need to get involved in something that, even though I’m trans, really has nothing to do with me. \n\nDoesn’t really have anything to do with Boris either, though of course that’s not the point. My…… situation is just another bit of meat for him to throw at the rabid right to stoke his culture war and distract from the fact that he’s a complete and total arse of a person. \n\nLet’s be clear – being trans sucks. I don’t know anyone that wants to be trans. What we want is to be how we feel inside, no different from anyone else. It’s just a bit more challenging then getting a boob job or some fillers. Want we want is to be able to live in peace without discrimination for existing. What we want is for billionaire authors not to spend their time writing tweets about how evil we are. \n\nThe problem is, all the hubbub about trans in sport, trans in this, bathrooms, etc is that when it boils down to actions on the street, life becomes more dangerous. \n\nI want to be able to go have a shit at work without stressing that someone’s going to take offense. I can’t “pick one”, I don’t *pass* as either gender so either way someone’s going to be unhappy! \n\nI want to be able to go to the cinema, or a concert, and use the facilities without being scared I’m going to get assaulted. Right now, I just *don’t go to anything fun, ever, unless my (cis female) partner is with me* because I can’t deal with the confrontation. I plan any travel with the hope I can access bathrooms on route easily and try and match my appearance to one gender or another. I don’t want to become yet another trans person assaulted in a train station. \n\nI want to be able to apply to a job without either being rejected because the recruiter is transphobic or desperately hunted by corporates because I tick like five things on their diversity quota. I mean I’ll take the second one but I would still prefer to be taken on my own merits for the work I do. \n\nI want my trans men friends to be recognised as the amazing people they are who exist. I want cis women to realise that if this culture war keeps going, you’re going to have to share your bathrooms with some really manly men who just don’t happen to have a penis. \n\nBut really at the end of the day I just want to bitch about the cost of living crisis, worry about Ukraine, go to work and come home knackered same as anyone else without having to deal with the government attempting to render my existence that of a second class (or worse) citizen. \n\nMy life doesn’t revolve around being trans. It’s just a part of it. Too big a part, really. But the way things are going, it will have to get bigger. When the Prime Minister creates and flames culture wars that target minorities, people will be hurt. There are those that think it gives them the right to hurt others, that they are in the right for doing so. \n\nI don’t want to die in a train station toilet because someone decided I shouldn’t be there and got angry about it.",

                "The atmosphere on this sub has been really fucking nasty on this topic recently, so well done on having the courage to post this. It would be great to see *some* discussion of the actual issues that trans people face, but lately it seems everyone's only interested in talking about you as an obstacle or an \"issue\". I can only imagine how horrible that's been to watch unfold; solidarity.\n\n**Edit:** Hello everyone. I didn't expect this little comment I wrote to become the top comment on the top post on the subreddit, but here we are. So, first of all, it's heartening to see that so many people feel the same way as I do about this media storm around trans folk. I figure a lot of people are going to see this comment yet, so I think it would be worthwhile to try and raise some awareness of some bits and bobs. \n\nFirst of all, [there's a protest at Westminster tomorrow](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/04/09/lgbt-protesters-get-ready-to-unite-and-tell-the-government-ban-trans-conversion-therapy-now/) opposing the exclusion of trans people from the recent conversion therapy ban. If you're available and able to get there, and you care about this issue, I suggest going and showing your support. \n\nThe one thing missing from many of the recent conversations/arguments in the media about trans people is any actual input from trans people themselves, so here are some trans voices I think are worth listening to for anyone who is equally tired of seeing the conversation begin and end with cisgender people asking other cisgender people about penises:\n\n* I've been spending part of my Saturday afternoon watching [this new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YStd1SWedPc) from Owen Jones. He has three trans guests on and they talk about a number of issues including conversion therapy and the struggle for trans people to get the healthcare they need and are legally entiteld to. You might not like Owen Jones but he has been consistently good for discussing issues by centring people actually affected by those issues, which imo puts his coverage on trans-related topics head and shoulders above much of what we see from other media outlets.\n* Abigail Thorn is a British trans woman who makes educational videos on her YouTube channel, Philosophy Tube. I found her [coming out statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-TrnwH4iQ) and [subsequent long-form video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AITRzvm0Xtg) moving and informative on the experience of someone coming to terms with their gender identity.\n* Shon Faye is a journalist and trans woman. I've found her writing and interviews to always be well-reasoned and informative, and last year she released a book, [The Transgender Issue](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/315/315349/the-transgender-issue/9780141991801.html), which became a Sunday Times Bestseller. I haven't got round to reading it yet but I'm looking forward to digging into it. \n* [Freddy McConnell](https://freddymcconnell.com/), who you may have heard of as \"the man who gave birth\", a freelance journalist and writer who has written for The Guardian and Vice among others, as well as producing a documentary on his experience with fatherhood as a trans man.",
                "Well done on identifying exactly what’s going on here. \n\nBoris Johnson doesn’t give a fuck about sport. He just desperately wants us to talk about this rather than his corruption scandals even if it gets you killed. He’s prepared to sacrifice the lives of British citizens for his political gain and nothing more. \n\nStay safe out there.",
                "Trying to avoid being a far-left cliché and all \"eat the rich\".   \n\nBut my theory for a while has been that a significant portion of these culture wars which have been coming to the forefront for a few years now. It's really just people (Left and right wing) consciously or subconsciously realising that society just doesn't seem to be working anymore (at least for them) and I think they instinctively reach out to something to blame.    \n\nBroadly speaking the right looking at these newer changes/concepts/movements and thinking change is the problem and the left looking at the right (in their eyes) and seeing an outdated perspective\n\nWhich makes the weaponization and violence of these cultural divides so much worse. In the middle of an ecological catastrophe and we're too busy fighting each other to be in charge of the wasteland when it's all over.   \n\nSorry to go off topic from your post."

Its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal meaning.\n\n\n- We believe the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation's collective memory. We honour the survivors still with us, and reaffirm our shared goals of mutual understanding and justice.\n\n\n- We must make sure that future generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon its consequences.

Genocide, antisemitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue. We have a shared responsibility to fight these evils.**\n\n\n**- We pledge to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research about the Holocaust and other genocide. We will do our utmost to make sure that the lessons of such events are fully learnt.**\n\n\n- We will continue to encourage Holocaust remembrance by holding an annual Holocaust Memorial Day. **We condemn the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism.

Every pound paid in corporation tax helps sustain the Kremlin’s war economy and its army’s abuses.\n\n“We urge the royal house to reconsider our request at this critical point in Ukraine’s fight for its survival and independence.”\n\nFirms with links to Russia given a royal warrant by Queen Elizabeth also include Nestle, Unilever, Cadbury (owned by Mondelez), Reckitt and flooring manufacturer Forbo.\n\nMondelez itself was not awarded a warrant but Cadbury has been a warrant holder since 1854 when it was awarded by Queen Victoria.\n\nNestle, Mondelez, Unilever and Bacardi have been accused of being “international sponsors of war” by the Ukrainian government, which until recently published a list of companies it deemed to be indirectly funding the war.\n\n  \n**Article Link:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2024/05/12/king-removes-royal-warrant-from-russian-linked-firms/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2024/05/12/king-removes-royal-warrant-from-russian-linked-firms/)",

The profits were more than double the same period in 2021.\r  \nThe roaring trade for Shell, BP and other major oil and gas companies has stood in contrast to households and much of the rest of the economy, who have had to deal with higher energy prices that have caused inflation to soar to 40-year highs in the UK and elsewhere, and which threaten to tip economies into recessions across much of the world.\r  \nThe scale of the oil companies’ profits prompted the UK government to eventually give in to demands for a windfall tax to redistribute some of the profits, although some senior Conservative ministers are thought to favour removing the tax, amid a leadership campaign that will lead to a new prime minister and cabinet in September.\r  \nThe windfall tax – known as the energy profits levy – will not apply until 14 July, meaning the second-quarter profits and payouts to shareholders were not affected.\r  \nYet it has remained a bonanza for Shell and its shareholders, who received $7.4bn in the first quarter of 2022 and will receive another $6bn in a share buyback and $1.8bn in dividends announced on Tuesday.\r  \nShell said it had experienced “higher realised prices, higher refining margins and higher gas and power trading”.\r  \nVladimir Putin’s invasion has meant that Shell may have to abandon its stake in the Sakhalin-2 gas project with Russia’s Gazprom. Yet the recognised costs of abandoning Russia are $4.3bn – just over a third of the profits Shell has made in three months since Kremlin troops entered Ukraine. The company had already booked costs worth $4.2bn related to its withdrawal from Russia, but it increased this estimate by only $111m in the second quarter of the year.\r  \nShell said it expected the tight energy market was here to stay. It added $4.3bn to its income attributable to shareholders to account for higher than expected prices in the mid- and long-term “reflecting the current energy market demand and supply fundamentals”.\r  \nBen van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, recognised the “huge challenges for consumers, governments and companies alike” caused by the “volatile energy markets”, but argued that the company is “using our financial strength to invest in secure energy supplies which the world needs today, taking real, bold steps to cut carbon emissions and transforming our company for a low-carbon energy future.”",
                "I know someone who recently worked for Shell. They have canned every single research project into oil that doesn’t involve ships and I mean every single one. They are now only backing electric and battery research projects. I think they also took a massive hit in the pandemic, probably profiteering off oil while they still can and trying to funnel lots of money into building a company which can exploit the future as well as the present. They took that $4.3 billion hit on that company they disbanded in Russia as well.\n\n$10bn in profit is absolutely and completely disgraceful though. Windfall Tax the shit out of them please."

Yes, what is happening in Ukraine is terrible, yes the alleged war crimes committed by Russia are horrific if what Ukraine says about them is true and Ukraine has all of our sympathies. However it shouldn't take precedence over the dire poverty, many are going to be facing soon or are already dealing with.  \n\n  I don't to hear another politician's hot take on Ukraine, until I hear their hot take on fuel poverty in this country. On food insecurity in this country. On NI contribution rises. At the end of the day, those MP's that work in Westminster, are our politicians. Our taxes pay for their salaries, and yet many of them, have 90 percent of their twitter feed/ other social media feed focused on Ukraine. I've heard more in the last month or so, about providing Ukrainians refugees with homes, then our own citizens. \n\nI'm turning 27 in May, and I can safely say that if things do not change in a radical way, I'll never own a property of my own. I live near Morden, in the borough of Merton, where an ordinary house  built for a working class family goes for £900,000, if not for more. In a town where the average salary is 40k on paper but most are earning a lot, lot less. How many people even with a salary of 40k, after taxes, rent, food, utilities etc can even afford a house that expensive and we are talking about Morden here, it ain't Mayfair, it ain't even Tooting Bec. Tooting Bec if you know London, is another area once considered working class, and some flats there go for more than a million. It's insanity. The housing crisis, has been going on for more than a decade now, and it's only gotten worse. People are going on and on about the Russian oligarchs, but aren't talking about the Saudi money, or the other ill gotten gains we've let pour into our economy and our property market. \n\nThe Ukraine Crisis might go on for months if not years. There is nothing the British public can do to stop the war, there isn't much our government can do, but at the very least, we've sent weapons and aid to Ukraine to give them a fighting chance. We need to turn our attention back to the dire problems  our country is facing.",

There are either events on the ground that gives clues into what the outcome of the war will be or political developments that tell us what the long-term consequences will be.\n\nThe cost of living crisis is by comparison a slow-burning story with each day not bringing such major developments.

The country has been taken away from you under the false pretence of your own consent. \n\n\"We voted for it and we knew exactly what we were voting for, we voted for Brexit, nobody tricked me\" \n\nI'm sorry but define that buzzword for me again, Brexit. It was a vote to leave the European Union right, we didn't want to be dictated to by \"foreign\" \"far away and detached\" bureaucrats that \"didn't have our best interests at heart\". We disowned not only our neighbours but weakened the number of failsafes between ourselves and even greater levels of corruption and fascism. We centralised power back fully to Westminster and to a Conservative government motivated purely by profit.\n\nTo those of you who were sold it under the pretence of controlling our own borders to protect our jobs and our families from dangerous foreigners, you were fooled. The danger to your jobs and to your family are not those trying to get into the country but its the ones that are already here and running it and the ones that \"donate\" to their cause. \n\nA government motivated by profit and the failsafes provided by joint venture and having accountability to our neighbours removed left us more open to corruption, institutions and influence sold to the highest bidder, more so than ever before. \n\nOne of those bidders is the American corporate mafia and the other is Vladimir Putin. \n\nPutin stood to benefit hugely from a weakened European Union, removing one of its most powerful and influential members. \n\nPutin stood to benefit from the creation of two new divided states, a divided Europe and a divided United Kingdom. \n\nPutin stood to benefit when Europe's largest financial centre lowered its standards in financial conduct and accepted his dirty money with no questions asked. \n\nNone of us blinked an eye as this already proven war criminal stored his war chest here but of course our government sprung to life to express its disgust when that war chest was used to kill civilians. Like the over the top reaction of a child pointing the blame at his little brother when they're both caught stealing sweets from the sweety jar \"I can't believe he's done this\" \"we condone this in the strongest possible terms\". The writing was on the wall much much earlier than the few weeks warning we were given of an invasion in Ukraine this year. \n\nThis started as a message to my fellow Brits but this could happen to other countries and it is. France has a presidential election in just a few days time, the front runner is the incumbent Macron but the hot new anti-establishment candidate (sound familiar) is the far right Marine Le Pen. Who is Le Pen's biggest donar? Putin. \n\nFrance, do not allow Putin to grow his fascist network in Europe anymore than he already is. Vote against Le Pen, if she wins by 51% take to the street and don't leave until she is ripped from her seat, god knows the French have more balls than we do when it comes to mass dissent and effective protest. \n\nGermany is strangled by a dependency on Russian energy, feeding their war machine daily but unable to act in any other way than to increase their military budget by 100 billion euros. Let's hope its a precaution.\n\nAs for the US, I really hope not but Trump 2024 would really not surprise me. Fascist brothers in arms with Putin, or so Trump would like to think, in reality he is just another greedy  puppet of Moscow. \n\nI don't need to tell anyone that Europe is at an extremely fragile point in its history once again. If you ask the generation that lived through the Nazis they will tell you their rise did not come over night, the signs were there and it was inaction..\nand I'm afraid cooperation that allowed them to grow unabated for so long.\n\nThe fight against fascism is constant, do not avert your gaze and call it out loudly when you see it.\n\n[Banks](https://imgur.com/a/mhHgkA9)\n\nEDIT: Its good to trigger some discussion. A couple of  things to add from what others have said. \n\nThis post reads like I was suggesting the UK leaving the European Union ie  Brexit was Putins idea which of course is totally wrong. It was however a movement that he saw and fuelled and used to drive a wedge, he was 100% involved. Follow the money trail, all roads lead back to Putin.\n\nEDIT 2: a couple of sources \n\n[Intelligence and Security Committee Russia report](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee_Russia_report)\n\n\"According to the report, there is substantial evidence that Russian interference in British politics is commonplace.\"\n\n[The Conservative Party and Putin's Russia: a story of total moral failure](https://youtu.be/HAFsWN-aEWY)",

                "George Grylls\nTuesday December 13 2022, 12.15pm GMT, The Times\n\nThe Royal Marines have taken part in covert operations in Ukraine, a senior general has admitted for the first time.\n\nLieutenant General Robert Magowan said the commandos supported “discreet operations” in a “hugely sensitive environment”. He said their missions carried “a high level of political and military risk”.\nMagowan is the former commandant general of the Royal Marines, having joined the Royal Navy’s elite unit in 1989.\n\nWriting in the Globe and Laurel, the official publication of the Royal Marines, he described how 350 marines from 45 Commando were sent to escort diplomats from the British embassy at the beginning of the year when it became clear that Russian troops were massing for an invasion. The commandos returned to Kyiv in April to protect the embassy as Britain sought to re-establish diplomatic presence after President Putin withdrew his forces from the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence had previously acknowledged the presence of commandos protecting embassy staff, with up to about 30 personnel believed to have been deployed. However, it is the first time the military has admitted that British forces have also taken part in special operations while in Ukraine.\n\n“In January this year, 45 Commando Group deployed at short notice — from the depths of a dark, north Norwegian winter, to evacuate the British embassy in Kyiv to Poland. The go-to 999 international emergency force, if you will,” Magowan wrote.\n\n“Then in April, they returned into the country to re-establish the diplomatic mission, providing protection to critical personnel. During both phases, the commandos supported other discreet operations in a hugely sensitive environment and with a high level of political and military risk.”\n\nBased at RM Condor in Arbroath on the North Sea coast, 45 Commando are specialists in Arctic warfare. The battalion-sized unit was heavily involved in the Falklands conflict when commandos took part in the battle for Port Stanley and the unit also saw action in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, 45 Commando were taking part in exercises in Norway when they were rapidly redeployed to Poland to help with the evacuation. During their training in the frozen mountains and fjords above the Arctic Circle, temperatures dropped to minus 35C.\n\nAs well as conducting special operations in Ukraine, Magowan praised the marines for their role in helping to train Kyiv’s armed forces. “Alongside wider defence, we have been heavily involved in training hundreds of Ukrainian military personnel throughout this summer. We are also planning to train Ukraine marines,” Magowan said.\n\nThe Times revealed earlier this year that British special forces were on the ground in Kyiv helping to train local troops. Military trainers were first sent to Ukraine following the invasion of Crimea in 2014 but were withdrawn in February to avoid the prospect of a direct conflict with Russian forces. However, Ukrainian commanders said they had received further training from British troops on the use of anti-tank Nlaws following the invasion.\n\nThe UK has also deployed cyber security experts to protect critical Ukrainian ministries. The specialists have been working remotely on behalf of the British government to foil attacks since February.\nA Royal Navy spokesman said: “Royal Marines were deployed to Ukraine to support the UK’s diplomatic presence in the country. They served no combat function.”",
                "So they were escorting politicians and helping evacuate diplomats, which is fine. They were also helping to train some troops, which I thought had been public knowledge for months now?\n\nSeems like quite a sensationalist headline.",
                "Would be nice if we could deploy a few more of those groups to \\*really\\* shit the Russians up.."

To claim that ⁦Boris Johnson 'has taken a lead globally in standing up to Putin' is an illusion only possible in Brexit la la land.\"\n\nHis intervention comes after Mr Johnson sparked fury by likening Ukraine's struggle against the Russian invasion to Brexit.\n\nDonald Tusk, a former president of the European Council, dismissed Mr Johnson's comments at the Tory spring conference as offensive to Ukrainians, the British people, and \"common sense\" itself.\n\nBut Sajid Javid, the UK health secretary, endorsed claims Mr Johnson had taken a lead on television on Monday morning.\n\n“When it comes to Boris Johnson and Ukraine, it’s hard to find any world leader that’s done more to support Ukraine at this time,\" Mr Javid told the BBC Breakfast programme.\n\nThe UK has sent arms to Ukraine and sanctioned Russian individuals and entities – but has been criticised for being slower to crack down on Kremlin-linked money than Europe.\n\nBritain is also the only major European country not to have a full open door policy for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, and has so far taken fewer refugees than its neighbours.\n\nMr Johnson will visit Brussels on Thursday for a Nato summit, but he has not been invited to attend an EU leaders’ summit on the same day.\n\nHis absence comes despite US president Joe Biden being expected to attend the meeting. The prime minister gave up his automatic seat on the European Council when he left the EU.\n\nMr Johnson told the Tory spring conference in Blackpool over the weekend: \"I know that it's the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, every time. I can give you a couple of famous recent examples.\n\n\"When the British people voted for Brexit in such large, large numbers, I don't believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners.\n\n\"It's because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.\"",

Please see it here:  https://twitter.com/ScotchSirin/status/1501325553718210564?s=20&t=UB96e5rCQpVZQnbyhTE4ug \n\nBelow is a copy of an email that my mother wrote to our MP, MSP (we live in Scotland), and the Home Office. I have full permission to spread it around. As many people need to know about how the British government is treating Ukrainian refugees.\n\nI am sure by now you must have heard about it, but I beg you, please give it a read. It is one thing to hear about the visa scheme issues in abstract numbers (50, 300, 17 thousand applicants...) but another thing to see the struggle of one person.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n>I am writing to you today as your constituent about  a personal issue, but it is also something that is currently affecting  many thousands of people in the UK and in Ukraine. I apologize for the  long message, but I think it’s important to  describe the situation in some detail to explain its full implications.  \n>  \n>As you know, Russia is currently conducting a  brutal, genocidal war against Ukrainian people, which is specifically  targeting civilians, and as of now about 1.7 million people have left  the country, fleeing the hostilities. Last Friday,  my mother had to leave the city of Kharkiv, which is currently  experiencing constant shelling and aerial bombardment, due to its close  proximity to the Russian border. On the first leg of her journey, she  took a 20-hour long ride on an evacuation train, which  was so packed with refugees that she had to stand for the entire time –  only women with young children and the frail were able to get a seat.  No one was allowed to take any luggage larger than a small handbag, as  the evacuation teams at the railway station  were trying to take in as many people as possible. So she left her home  city, where she spent most of her life, with just clothes on her back,  her passport, some money and a 500ml water bottle. The train took her to  Lviv, a city in Western Ukraine that is  relatively safe at the moment. She spent a night there and took a bus  to the Polish border, which she crossed on foot after standing in a 10  hour long queue. Once on the Polish side of the border, she got help  from volunteers who provided her with transport  to Krakow, where I was able to book her a hotel and where she had her  first meal in almost three days. I am telling you this story because it  is not unique just to my mother, it is very similar for all Ukrainian  people who are currently fleeing from the war.  My mother is luckier than most because as of this morning, her home was  still standing, none of her family and friends have been killed or  wounded, and she has enough money to pay for her food and lodging. She  is also in relatively good health, despite her  age (she is 72), and does not have a young child or a frail elderly  relative who needs constant care.  \n>  \n>As soon as she started her journey, I filled out  the application form for her UK visa, under the new Ukraine Family  Scheme. This took me a few hours to complete, and I kept wondering about  appropriateness and relevance of some of the questions.  For instance, certain parts of the application form asked about  involvement of the applicant in war crimes and terrorist activities,  which struck me as particularly tone deaf under the circumstances. In  addition to this, some of the documents that are required  to support the application are impossible to obtain, or are irrelevant.  For example, the application checklist asked for a current bank  statement, and for evidence of close family members remaining in  Ukraine. My mother’s bank in Kharkiv was physically destroyed  by a ballistic missile, so it won’t be issuing any bank statements to  its clients for a while. As for family members, most refugees would have  none remaining in Ukraine, so there can be no evidence.  \n>  \n>Once I completed the application, I discovered that  there had to be a minimum of a 2 week wait until the next available  appointment to submit biometric data, since all visa centres across  Europe are struggling with the influx of Ukrainian  applicants. My mother visited the Rzeszow visa application centre  today, which is exclusive to Ukraine Family Scheme applicants, and there  were at least several hundred people trying to get in, some being  turned away even though they had appointments. Just  to reiterate, every single one of these people has been traumatised by  staying in bomb shelters, often for many days at a time, by loss of  their possessions, home, and sometimes loved ones. To make them wait  several weeks before they can join their relatives  in the UK who are ready to offer them refuge and support is simply  inhumane. It also serves no useful purpose since most of these people  are already known to the Home office. They have most likely been granted  UK visas in the past, and like my mother, have  passed all the security checks and submitted their biometric data  multiple times already. These people are overwhelmingly women, children  and elderly. All Ukrainian men who can hold arms have been going back to  Ukraine to join the army or the territorial reserve.  I simply fail to see how an elderly woman, or a mother with a young  child who are fleeing from war in a country that has always been UK’s  close friend and ally, can present a security risk to the UK state.  \n>  \n>British people have been able to visit Ukraine  visa-free since 2012, and they always received the warmest welcome in  the times of peace. Ukrainians, meanwhile, have enjoyed visa-free travel  in the Schengen countries since 2017, and this,  to the best of my knowledge, has not caused any migration or security  issues. Perhaps it is time for the UK to review its visa policy towards  Ukraine, so that, in this hour of greatest need, our Ukrainian relatives  could join their families in the UK on a  short term basis without unnecessary red tape. For now it is not clear  how long the war will last. They might only need a few weeks’ refuge  until they are able to return home. If they need to stay longer, they  could apply for an extension of their stay from  within the UK. Once the war is over, most people will be able to return  to their homes immediately, but for some it will take perhaps a few  months as several Ukrainian towns have been completely destroyed and  will take time to rebuild. Circumstances could  be assessed individually so that everyone gets fair treatment. This is  not only for the sake of refugees themselves, but also to help the  countries in continental Europe whose services are already starting to  break down because too many people are coming in  too quickly – and yet our friends in Poland, Romania, Slovakia,  Hungary, Germany and all other EU member countries are doing all they  can to help. I am not alone in thinking that I would rather use my own  funds to help my mother, so that she can give up her  place in Poland to someone who perhaps has greater need.  \n>  \n>I apologize, again, for the long message. I quite  understand that with this crisis unfolding so suddenly and so quickly,  it is very difficult to adjust policies and make the right decisions.  People in Ukraine are extremely grateful to the  United Kingdom for supplying defensive weapons before Russia attacked,  as this certainly was one of the major factors that held the initial  assault until such time that Ukrainian cities could be fortified to fend  off the main offensive. They are also grateful  for the financial help for the Ukrainian government and for the ever  increasing sanction pressure on Russia. All of these things are making a  difference. But war cannot be won with weapons and sanctions alone.  Ukrainian civilians need to be protected by all  means available, so that once the war is over, country could be rebuilt  and normal life restored as quickly as possible. A waiver, even  temporary, of short-term visas for Ukrainian nationals, is what the  United Kingdom can do now to provide immediate help  and humanitarian relief.  \n>  \n>Thank you for reading this letter. I am happy to  provide any further information if needed. I hope that you will find my  thoughts on this matter relevant and that they will make a difference.  \n>  \n>With all best wishes,  \n>  \n>NB\n\nI do not ask for Tory-bashing, please. We are posting this here not because we want to complain or criticise them (as rightly deserved as it is) but because we want change. Please, Reddit. Spread this around, contact your local MP, contact the Home Office, protest, put pressure on the government however you can.

The psychiatrist gave her a list of numbers and she just had to phone through them. \n\nShe was able to put her name on lists at some practices, but she had to call many of them several times to get someone on the phone, but after two weeks of phoning she had a prompt initial appointment. After that it took a few more weeks before the regular appointments could start, but all in all things were progressing steadily.\n\nIn the case that no therapist is found within a certain period of time, you can also try to find a therapist for private patients. The costs are then covered by statutory health insurance - many people don't know this, but you can find all necessary information online or your own health insurance provider can advise you (do that before booking something anyway).",

More likely it would last for many years - untill Russia fully colapses. \n\nWhat is his long term goal? Why do you think Scholz is doing what he is doing?",

                "I think the deal is pretty clear-cut: \n\nScholz does not want Germany to act in any military context on its own, as in, taking the initiative. They are waiting for the US to lead the way, for France to act first, for whatever. \n\nThere are more speculative ideas floating around which I don't buy, such as that SCholz is in Putin's pocket (the amount of Russian gas we are currently importing should prove the opposite) or that he is just a coward. \n\nI think it is much more clear: Scholz does not want to be the leader here and he does not want Germany to lead the way here.  Because he wants transatlantic approval. \n\nIts less a question of cowardice and more a question of comfortable roles. \n\nRemember that this is neither a NATO nor a UN thing - the general role structures are not here. Therefore I find it very important that it was recently the EU parliament that stacked up the heat on Scholz to deliver ( lead by the German ***GREENS*** \\- who would've thunk!). A it gives supranational scrutiny which is probably what Scholz needs  - and it gives the EU a large more responsibility and soft power, which I like very much.",

They just don’t want to be the first in this weapon category \n\nSee also\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10fg79m/berlin_wont_allow_exports_of_german_tanks_to/",
                "Your guess is as good as ours. Scholz doesn't show his hand and we don't even know if that leaked information is really an ultimatum or just an option that was discussed and then leaked to put pressure on him. But he doesn't seem the type that easily succumbs to public pressure, so we'll just have to wait and see what the NATO meeting on Friday will decide.",
                "I fully understand Scholz at least commercially - US help is via lend lease - so someone pays US for all that - probably EU which is mostly Germany and other EU states\n\nGermany and most other EU country help Ukraine similar as Canada as a free donation...\n\nSo US is just sucking the blood out of Ukraine via lend lease and asking Germany to go ahead for free is redicolous.\n\nAs President Biden recently signed a Lend Lease Act for Ukraine, nothing Kyiv will receive is for free.\n\nThe Lend-Lease must be paid back, either through monetary means or via the use of American contractors to help reconstruct the country, allowing present loans to be rerouted back toward the US economy. For example, it took Britain and Russia several decades to pay back their lease from ww2. Both were repaid in full by 2006.\n\nSo Scholz is potentially twisted at least commercially. US needs to at least send their Tanks on similar condition as EU because in the end EU pays US for their help..."

It still happens, but - we write that person off as an asshole and get on about our day. \n\n\nThe \"I'll be nice if I feel like it\" aspect to culture here I experience as very antisocial, because there is a truth to the way I was raised, I see it. People here can be negative under the guise of realism but the general, low-lying pessimism brings me down, and other outsiders experience it the same way. \n\n\nI find the stunting of emotions, where you are raised to be indifferent to others' emotional state, somewhat unnatural, as we are social creatures, after all. \n\n\nSo, yeah. I find making your bad mood other people's problem rude. It's nice to be nice, basically. A lot of Germans think that if you're being nice, you must be fake. No - it's not for you, it's for me. I don't want to walk around with a raincloud over my head all day, thanks, but no thanks. So after the bad interactions, I dust myself off, and I try to be nice to the next person.\n\n\nMy culture is very open, though so take it with a pinch of salt.

                "Well, that's not much of an article. It's barely longer than the headline.\n\nAs much as I understand Zelenskyy's extreme frustration -- and of course he's going to beg for membership of both NATO and the EU -- there are good reasons why, right now, this would be the wrong thing to do.\n\nEU membership isn't a thing that can be fast-tracked. Any country wanting to join the EU must adhere to a very strict set of criteria. Turkey has been trying to get in for decades but has failed to meet the criteria every time; you can't hand instant membership over to a country just because it's been invaded.\n\nAnd of course, the moment Ukraine joined the EU and NATO, those entities would themselves be at war with Russia. It's tempting to think that this would help Ukraine, because then Russia would be up against the full might of the West etc. etc., but it would amount to a declaration of war and an escalation that would give Putin the excuse he needs to deploy biological, chemical, or -- if he's insane enough -- nuclear weapons. And that's exactly what we have to avoid.\n\nUnderstand that the Putin propaganda machine is attempting to blame \"NATO expansion\" and \"western aggression\" for the invasion. He's using classic bully-boy tactics: he's trying to provoke the west into declaring war, so that he can bomb London, Washington and New York, as well as finally lay waste to Kyiv (with a small, tactical nuke, if necessary).\n\nIf there is any hope for less destructive end to this war, it lies in giving Putin a way for him to retreat while claiming victory. Time for this strategy is running out, as he is showing more and more signs of paranoia, but it can still work.\n\nHe's on the back foot, his invasion has all but stalled, Ukrainians are fighting back harder than ever, and the Russian economy is shot to ribbons. If there are any military strategists who think he could actually win, I don't know of them.\n\nSo a possible way out for Putin is for us to say that if he withdraws his troops now and stops the air and missile attacks, we can ensure that Ukraine stays neutral and then he can claim that he has successfully \"stopped NATO expansion\" and thus the \"special military operation\" has achieved its main aim. We can send neutral UN peacekeeping forces into Donbas and Luhansk, and start work on providing Ukraine with the humanitarian and economic aid it so badly needs.\n\nAnd if we can do that, then we can figure out how to get Putin in front of a war crimes tribunal. But right now, our first priority is to stop the killing, and that's not going to be done by providing Putin with the excuse he needs to kill even more people than he already is.",
                "I really understand that he's trying everything he can to stop the Russians killing even more of his people. But as harsh as that is, he must understand that other countries have their own interest to protect their people. Nobody wants a direct war with Russia, least of all NATO members. He managed to get an impressive amout of support, weapons, volunteers still trickling into Ukraine, more than any country being invaded ever got. But I think that's as far as the rest of Eurpe is willing to go. NATO will not involve themselves directly, and the EU will not just ingnore all their own rules and fast track a process with tremendous consequences for the whole union.",
                "Look, god love him, and glory to the people of Ukraine.\n\nBut if it's about a state at war (with a non-NATO nuclear power, even) not bcoming a NATO member right then, or about a state not being offered immediate membership in the EU, when it has literally all the way to still go on the acquis communitaire, then I'll gladly share in this 'blame'.",

When it became clear that I would stay in Germany for a long time, I took intensive German courses and quit my job. I also started learning front-end development on my own. Having researched the job market in Germany, I was upset: all employers require a diploma in computer science. In Ukraine, a higher education diploma is not a prerequisite for getting a job in the IT field. In Ukraine, I received a bachelor diploma in tourism business management. I have never worked in this field. I worked as a translator from Turkish (which I learned myself). And for the last 4 years I have worked at an Affiliate company as a customer service manager. After the start of Covid, I completely switched to remote work. And then the war began.\n\nSo my question is how can I find a job as a front-end developer in Germany.\nWhat do I have?  I'm currently learning German to get it to B1 level. I already feel more or less fluent in html/CSS. Now I have started to intensively study JavaScript. I'm already a little familiar with APIs and React. In the future I will also learn Typescript and .NET. My learning assistants: Odeon project, course on Udemy and, of course, Google. \n\nNow my question is: what do I need to find a job in Germany? I am a woman, I am 29 years old. I live in the small town of Rheda-Wiedenbrück, North Rhine-Westphalia. I don't have the opportunity to enroll in a bachelor's degree. Should I go and do Ausbildung? This way I can study and get some money.  But the prospect of having a minimum salary for the next three years scares me. I'm confused. Also should I do a B2 in German? \n\nPlease share your experience and advices.",

You have to sort the list and select 5 for evaluation, of which 2 actually get a chance for an interview (actual numbers may vary, rough estimate).  \n\nAmong the first of those 45 that get sorted out will be all without any formal education. A simple \"but I promise you I can do that\" is not going to fly far with selection pressure...  \n\nThere are a lot of evening courses available, or a proper \"Ausbildung\" as already mentioned. It would help.",
                "So you basically have neither credentials nor experience. Entry-level positions in IT in general, in web-dev especially, are hell even for recent graduates with Master's degrees. Without German (B1 isn't going to cut it) it's practically not possible to find anything. \n\nI'm not even sure who told people that \"learning to code\" is a viable career option in Germany for people with no formal education (credentials) or considerable experience.  \n\n>  I don't have the opportunity to enroll in a bachelor's degree. \n\nWhy not? It would actually be the best option for you, especially if you can also find some coding HiWi position which would allow you to collect a bit of experience.\n\n>  But the prospect of having a minimum salary for the next three years scares me.\n\nAs opposed to what? Didn't you say you quit your previous job?",
                "Good comments here already, but here’s another take since I know quite a few people that went that route:\n- Learn as much about FE and look for QA jobs. \n\nWhy is that? Entry levels are way easier, you know coding and general knowledge of FE so quite valuable for testings. You can get easier into companies like that, and then you pivot and offer coding skills in your team and prove you can do it. Over of course of a year you can switch to an official FE role if you’re good. This worked for few people I know who were legal and economists before.\n\nHave in mind although atm IT market is really bad, even for senior people, entry level roles and jobs are almost non existent this year and probably next year.",
                "I'd just go for it. Write some Bewerbungen, send it to a bunch of job ads, worst that can happen is you won't get in. I'd recommend B2 in every case.\n\nYou could also look for remote jobs in other cities, e.g. Berlin, there you oftentimes do not need to know German, or even other countries."

            "text": "I know its long, but its worthwhile, I promise.\n\nFor starters: I am white and from Australia. So my experiences could not be called racism. It is more subtle and harder to prove; which is why some often wonder if I am actually imagining all this. I have now lived in Germany for the past 20 years (half my life). I switched citizenship in 2016 and now possess only the German one (The German government required me to give up my Australian one!). I speak near perfect German, but with an accent. But I have come to the conclusion that Germans construct a barrier around themselves when interacting with people who don’t belong to their \"tribe\". I feel that if you were not born in this country you will never have a sense of fully belonging to German society (And even if you were born here, you may still have problems. I.e. not being white). There are always subtle traits of Germans letting you know that you are not one of them. This can involve:\n\n\\*Switching to English (I still have not yet met a German who speaks better English than I speak German; and this is not just me being egoistic). I don’t need help with my German. I am not an English teacher on wheels who gives free lessons. But this happens to me every day, even with people I have known for 20 years! But in a deeper sense I think switching to English mid conversation is an unconscious method of protecting their tribe from outsiders. I.e. the same way that a couple may have a certain (romantic/cute) way of speaking to each other alone, Germans like to protect their language and only speak it with their kind. And here I am not talking about at the Ämter or in the train (where newly arrived foreigners are forced to speak German), but rather with people I actually know and who know my German level.\n\n\\* Completely ignoring me when I ask a question. And no, this is not because they didn’t understand my German! I.e. pretending they didn’t hear.\n\n\\* Switching eye contact from me to my (German) girlfriend as soon as they hear my accent. Example: I was on holidays in Greece and we met another German couple, by chance, multiple times in a restaurant. They remembered us and offered us the remainder of their wine bottle because they wanted to go. Probably, since I was the man, they both directed their initial conversation at me. This particular time it took them a few minutes to pick up on my accent. But as soon as they detected it they seemed really confused, if not threatened. After that, including multiple other times where we popped into each other in some other villages nearby, they did not look at me and their focus shifted to my girlfriend – which is ironic because she was ignored at first for being a woman: they wanted approval from the man regarding the wine bottle!\n\n\\*Continously emphasizing the fact that you are not from Germany. \n\nAll of the above and other such similar subtle things have happened to me every day in Germany for the past 20 years. They happen too often for me to be imagining them.\n\nA lot of people say it is better in some other continental European countries. In terms of simple interactions like in a café or on the street, it is indeed easier and more relaxed in France, the Netherlands, Denmark, etc. However in terms of being accepted into society it is exactly the same as in Germany; and in Sweden or the Netherlands I would say it is even much worse (their tribes are much smaller the German tribe – so it needs to be protected even more). For example: imagine if a 20 year foreigner moves to a continental European country, gets citizenship, learns the language to near perfect, becomes accustomed to the culture, history, etc. 20, 40, 60 years later will the “native/ethnic” citizens accept this person as a German, Frenchman/woman, Dane, etc. Absolutely not, at least 90-99% of them will not. If that same people moves to Australia/ US/ Great Britian/ Canada/ New Zealand? Absolutely yes; at least, say 70-90%, will accept them as one of their own. There are two reasons for this:\n\n1.For a large portion of the continental Europe (I.e. in Germany AFD, CDU voters) nationality = ethnicity.\n\n2.For the remainder: at an absolute minimum you have to be born there, go to school there, speak the language without an accent, etc. (Auf Deutsch: “sozialisiert”). This explains why most young (progressive) Germans would actually consider a 10, 15, 20 year old of Turkish/ Italian/ Russian/ Greek/ Polish origin to be “one of them”, but do not consider me to be one of them, even if I have lived in the country far longer.\n\nI grew up in Sydney and there I knew multiple immigrants who were in the same situation as me now: they had lived about 20 years in Australiaa and were about 40. But not for a second did I even think about whether they actually belonged to this society and whether they were as Australian as me. Of course they were! But I am willing to maintain that not one of the 80 million Germans considers me as German as they are.\n\nI originally thought it was an American/Australian/Canadian thing: I.e. countries which have had huge immigration waves for hundreds of years. But that doesn’t explain why immigration is (generally speaking) much more successful in the UK than in continental Europe. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that it is an Anglo Saxon thing. More precisely an English thing: all the Anglo-Saxon countries have, internationally/relatively speaking, an English mentality. Sure, most immigrants to the US came from other countries, but these new immigrants adopted the existing English mentality very quickly. Now the question is: Why are the English (Or possibly the British) more accepting of outsiders into their society? I don’t have a definite answer to this. But maybe one possibility is that the UK has not been invaded by foreigners since 1066. There was widespread unrest and even civil wars up until 1689, but it was always Brit vs Brit or Englishman vs Englishman. Now compare this to continental Europe: Nonstop wars, tribe vs tribe, for the last 3000 years, right up until 1945, and in some cases even later: Balkans, Ukraine… Think about the 30 years’ war in Germany: the Swedish arrived, raped the woman, killed the men, burnt the villages and stole the harvest. The Spanish did the same thing the Netherlands for 80 years from 1568 onwards. And Germans of course were the experts in this field. All these conflicts involved one tribe against another tribe right up until 1945, and in terms of the historical mentality, it is very very recent. 1066, however, is a long time ago! Therefore, I believe in continental Europe the mentality has developed a natural defense mechanism against anything foreign. When such an encounter happens Europeans retreat into their own tribe as an unconscious protection mechanism.\n\nBy the way: Germany more immigrants as a percentage of popluation than the US and the UK! Large scale immigration to the UK also started at the same time as Germany: in the 1950's. So the argument \"we are still getting used to immigrants\" is completely bogus.\n\nSome people have mentioned to me, that that’s just the way it is in Germany/continental Europe, and that immigrants must accept this when choosing to migrate there. I.e. why should these countries change their whole mentality (assuming that this is even possible to do) because of some whining foreigners. On a superficial level this is true. Maybe I should just leave (Although I have no chance of getting back into Australia at 41 and immigrating at that age is not that easy. I.e. meeting new friends). But continental Europeans have to consider this: How do you seriously expect to compete in the 21st century if most (first generation) immigrants, including very highly skilled ones, don’t feel part of the society? Germany and the rest of continental Europe attracts hardly any Chinese, Indian, and African highly skilled workers compared the Anglo-Saxon countries. E.g., only 4% of Germany’s regular (i.e. excluding refugees) immigration is from outside of the EU. This immigration is a movement from poorer EU countries to richer ones. At some point this immigration will stop or greatly reduce, as Central Europe and countries like Spain and Portugal are growing much faster than Germany.\n\nThe most ironic thing about all of this is that I left Australia because I hated it and generally also the Anglo-Saxon mentality. This was 2003 during the Iraq war. I wanted to live in a country that was proactive on environmental issues, had good public transportation (despite the situation now in Germany its public transportation is still way better than in Anglo Saxon countries), had good bike infrastructure (see point about transportation), free health care, didn’t start wars, that had citizens who were were informed on world issues. And to be fair, I got all of these things by moving here. However, all of these things are nothing compared with the need to have a feeling of being accepted. So the ironic thing is that each day I am developing a larger and larger Anglo Saxon superiority complex. I guess I am being forced to retreat into the protection of my tribe.\n\nGermany: I tried. I learnt the language to a high level, I immersed myself in your literature, film, music. I lived in 4 Bundesländer (Munich, Berlin, Greifswald, Bochum). I joined sports clubs. I joined a political party. But you never treated my any differently from just another random tourist who was in Berlin for the weekend. To save my dignity I got bitter, I (mentally) returned to my people, to my tribe.",

Basicly, you apply to study fully at the new university, then after you are accepted you ask if they credit some of your previous courses. They are not obligated to, and unless it is the exact same course with the exact same content as one you would have to take, it is unlikely to happen. \n\n> Is it possible (though kinda scummy) to apply for a uni just to cross the border and then leave it instantly?

                "Regarding CDU for 16 years: if you are doing little to nothing, you get less bad press.\n\nRegarding Ampel: One thing is, they are constantly infighting. Opposition doesn't need to do a lot when the government is trashtalking their own policies in public.",
                "> So what exactly happened? and what am I missing about the German electorate?\n\nThat German voters have the same memory as a goldfish and blame all the current issues on the Ampel that were caused by bad decisions of the CDU in the past.\n\nAlso:\n- Olaf Scholz is often perceived as a weak leader who is inactive\n- FDP and green party constantly arguing and blockading each other\n- Many voters perceive the ampel as overly ideological and disconnected from the living reality of the people",
                "A good mix imo.\n\nFor one **Merkel and her gov't before the Ampel had the advantage of being in power during times** **of relative calm**, not requiring many actions. Sure there were some hick ups here and there but the Merkel gov't was doing about nothing for the most time and people interpreted the lack of controversial decissions as \"everyone being happy\" while basically all of our current problems were building up in silence. I remember how frustrating discussing politics was during that time, because everytime you'd bring up an issue, certain people would silence you by saying \"*But honestly now, do we really have it all bad? Life's good with Merkel, so why change anything?*\" ...I guess the calm spoiled them a little.  \nNow we're in a time of seemingly neverending catastrophies, many of them inflicted by the lack of decission making of the last 16 years and people are desperate to return to the quieter Merkel days. Of course the conservatives would have to take similarly unpopular decissions rn if they were in power, dare I remind you that most of the pandemic was handled by them and required taking similarly painful meassures, but it seems their voters just kinda forgot about that.\n\nThen there is the **infighting in the Ampel**. If anything it's remarkable how much they managed to get done in so little time, considering how often this happens. It's just not a good look to the public, people interpret that as a lack of control. It certainly doesn't help that Scholz is barely present as the leader of the gov't to step in and only ever pops up in the news when he loses his laptops or cosplays as a pirate.  \n\n\nA big problem is also the **lack of will to cooperate from the opposition**, especially from CDU/CSU. Whenever new laws are being discussed Merz and Söder are immediately against it, even if it means they have to contradict themselves. Not only does this complicate the process of passing laws, but it also divides the public. Of course laws should always be discussed (we live in a democracy after all) but what I'm missing from the CDU/CSU are constructive proposals on how to improve said laws. Instead they're just wildly gesturing towards some imaginative, magical \"innovation\" that fixes all of our current problems, someone might or might not have somewhen in the future or to just keeping things going as before \"*because there really are no issues*\". Well... And I guess using borderline AfD vocabulary when it comes to discussing issues with our migration system helped none of them, neither the Ampel, nor the CDU/CSU.\n\nBut imo a very big problem of the Ampel is all the (especially) **online propaganda**. The amount of alarmist, clickbait articles about any new laws the Ampel is discussing, the empty headed memes lacking any kind of substance or message which just serve to insult, and on top of that the alternative (conspiracy) media on YouTube, Telegram and elsewhere, framing themselves as \"independent truth seekers\", receiving undisclosed funding from shady sources, spreading straight up lies confirming people's paranoia.\n\nIt's even more complex then that, but I think this comment is already long enough and I guess those are the biggest problem the Ampel is facing.I personally am somewhat satisfied with them. Of course they aren't perfect, but at least were finally doing something about our problems instead of pretending they don't exist, doing nothing.",
                "The German electorate (and society) is just kinda inherently conservative, which isn't surprising given the average and median ages in Germany are around 45.\n\nProgressive and left-wing parties here usually win as a result of exceptional circumstances, such as the perceived poor handling of the pandemic, Merkel quitting politics and her successor being extremely weak in the case of the Ampel (and they still needed a libertarian party to cross the finish line). If those factors hadn't existed, we'd be looking at round 5 of Mutti right now.\n\nAnd, well, things tend to eventually go back to their original shape once the shock that has deformed them has passed.",
                "The Ampel must now do the painful steps which would have been necessary for the last 16 Years. In a very short time. So they get blamed for doing the right things."

How useful would a weapons system without ammunition be?   \n\n\nAs for other vehicles like IRIS-T, it was always said that they will need to be built first and can only arrive in a few months time.   \n\n\nPzH2000 require training which is now well underway, and will be in theater in a few weeks as per current estimates - as to \"only\" sending 7, that is more than was seen as reasonable by many in the Bundeswehr, considering how few we actually have in working condition.   \n\n\nThen there's the (in)famous concept of \"Ringtausch\" where Germany backfills some other NATO country so they can give their soviet equipment to Ukraine, which has created lots of controversy online, but mostly is squabbles about how much of an upgrade in equipment it is supposed to be for the countries (aka how greedy they can be) and the timeframe - for many of those units, they need to be refurbished OR built first as well.   \n\n\nAs to why other countries like Poland have given so much heavy equipment and Germany hasn't, don't forget that much of that stuff was given by Germany (for almost free) to those countries in the first place from ex-GDR stock (like the MIG29s for €1 each).   \n\n\nThere is way less flip-flopping involved if you ONLY look at statements by the actual government, not industry and other third parties.   \n\n\nCould Germany (or the west in general) do more? Absolutely.   \nStill, it feels like there is lots of Russian propaganda going around trying to open up old wounds and sow discontent between EU member states and NATO partners in an attempt to create infighting that will lead to an even weaker response to the crisis.",

Let's go through your articles:\n\n> Delivery of armored vehicles have been delayed according to The Guardian\n\nThe article actually says: \"(...) her government defends itself against criticism that its delay in authorising the delivery of heavy weapons is undermining the west’s unified stance\". So the point of contention is that Berlin had not authorized = promised any heavy weapons on 20 April when the article was published. The article does not say that Germany isn’t sending any weapons that were actually promised by the German government.\n\n> Germany has not sent any significant weapons to Ukraine. according to The Telegraph referring to Welt\n\nThe headline of the article: \"Germany has not sent promised large arms to Ukraine\". The text: \"Germany approved a delivery of heavy weapons including tanks in late April\". \n\nThe facts: No delivery of tanks to Ukraine was approved/promised by Germany in April (or ever). Germany approved the delivery of self-propelled howitzers. The German ministry of defense was quoted in this [6 May news report](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/ukraine-lambrecht-panzerhaubitzen-103.html) as saying that the training of soldiers usually takes 6 weeks. Another [news article reported on 11 May](https://www.dw.com/en/ukrainian-troops-arrive-in-germany-for-howitzer-training/a-61755368) that Ukrainian soldiers have arrived in Germany for the training. It is currently expected that the weapons will be delivered to Ukraine [in the next two weeks](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/innerhalb-der-kommenden-zwei-wochen-melnyk-nennt-lieferzeitpunkt-fuer-deutsche-panzerhaubitzen/28418188.html) which is in the 6-week period that was announced by the German government earlier.  \n\nI can not wait to see all the headlines in two weeks: \"Ukraine thanks Germany for keeping promise and delivering heavy weapons on time\"\n\n> Germany promises air defense systems according to DW. But none have yet been delivered according to Bloomberg and Kyiv Independent. \n\nThe air defense systems were promised on 1 June, which is less than two weeks ago. The German army does not own any of these systems, they will be delivered directly from the factory to Ukraine as soon as the company has produced them which is expected to be in October. No immediate delivery was ever promised by Germany.\n\nIf you have any other news articles which claim that Germany did not send any promised weapons, please send the link.

My teacher (who's the one that drafted a couple of students to be there for the diner) encouraged us to talk to the Ambassador about what's in the files.\n\nSubjects range from the GDP, to political parties, to the Chancellor, ... to the next elections, to the far-right party, to the issues with China, to the migration crisis, to the war in Ukraine, to the rise of extremism, and.. you get it.\n\nIsn't it \"rude\" (I can't find the right word, sorry) to talk about these kinds of things at the table? Wouldn't it lead to tension and maybe some bitter aftertaste ? Especially, since we'll be encouraged to start the discussion (which is contradictory because we were also told not to speak if not spoken to, which suggests that the Ambassador will be picking the topics ?). How would you navigate this ? Would you ask questions about these topics ?\n\nI must add that I had a private discussion with my professor who said that my participation was because the Ambassador really like my \"journey\" (I'm an immigrant, and I'll leave it at that to not give out more personal information), which might imply (in my mind at least), that he'll ask me questions about my country and the politics... (which are not good... but where are they good anyway x)).\n\nAlso, I had questions about étiquette.

Long wait times, email only appointments, always unavailability on phone, strong denials to speak even basic English and general dislike to Foreigners.\n\nI almost lost my job because of it; it has been 3 and half months now at Magdeburg Ausländerbehörde and still no processing of my work permit. For context, I finished my masters degree and have a contract with required salary.\n\nMy friend in another city has been waiting for visa for 2 months after processing, so she can unblock her blocked account and get access to money. Has been relying on borrowing from everyone. \n\nMy another friend also almost lost a job, because they didn't give him an appointment to change the company name on the work permit document, which BTW, they had mistakenly written down the old company's name.\n\nThis feeling of helplessness and constant worry and we don't even have a grievance forum. So many of us are facing these issues but no where to vent, no one to listen. We come to this country, ready to learn, integrate and pay the taxes. All we ask is cut us some slack and at least make the visa processing easier which is our kryptonite in a foreign country. \n\nWe are not expecting a favor, all we ask is a fundamental requirement to progress here. This is not a anger-filled post to paint this nation or its citizens in the bad light, rather a vent of helplessness.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit 1: Thank you all for so much support, to those providing solutions, to those sharing their stories which is way worse than we have, and even people who dmed me.\n\nFrom the comments, here is the summary; \n\n- People have had multitude of different experiences\n\n- The Ausländerbehördes in smaller cities and towns are faster compared to relatively big cities.\n\n- Culmination of current pandemic, war and staff shortage has been the reason and they are overwhelmed and overworked.\n\nTo all who provided these perspectives, I can tell you we get it (atleast most of us do, there would always be aholes), we keep our patience but we have to juggle our mental health and situation while sitting with daily fear that contract revocation is a real possibility. This will also make companies very skeptical to hire foreign workers for the time being. For eg. I personally know a person who desperately needed a student-job to support themselves during their studies and even company is willing to make a contract but only after her extended residence permit arrive. I know there are other way out of that particular situation 🙂 but I am just laying out one more example of how far it goes.\n\nThe solution right now is atleast make some reasonably faster way to get the Fiktionsbescheinigung while we wait for work permit or extension of visa. \n\nu/sweetsoursop in the comments suggested a digitization of the process and even have broken it down to what is required technically ❤️. To people reading that, yes it is that simple! Other countries have implemented it and I am sure there are service based companies who actually would have done and implemented this for other countries so you don't even need to build it in-house or start from scratch. \n\nPeople also have pointed to English language and it's problems legally and some have provided factual counter-arguments to it. Personally, during my visa extensions, I never expect to hold a conversation just with English. I know a little bit of german, use deepl to translate my mails and even go with a few complex vocab and phrases memorized and anyways there's not much to talk if the process is carried out as required. But in situations like this, we have to explain entire thing to staff at the reception or to security, as most places still don't allow inside without appointments. That's why I put little English, where we can frame sentence in English with technical terms in German, and hope that they understand from the context.",

My job gave up on me after three months, but I reapplied in February and got a position by the end of March, when I had my paperwork. \n\nIt’s absolutely terrible. I’m lucky I had enough saved up from coming over from the US, or I would have been forced to go back home with nothing to show for my trip. I can’t imagine how people survive who have to wait that long with no money and nobody to help them. It’s honestly borderline criminal, in my eyes."

The other two agreed since it seems to very important to Yellow. Everything worked well for some time. Traffic was somehow under control. Just once in a while Yellow screamed: \"I'm the most important here!\". The other two asked why he thinks he is more important, and Yellow said \"Because I always come before both of you!\". Red and Green just thought: \"Well, if you are happy with it.\".\n\nAfter some time the traffic got worse and Red and Green noticed that Yellow had gradually increased the time it was burning between the other two. They said: \"Yellow you can not do that. It disrupts traffic.\". But Yellow screamed \"No, I'm important I have to burn longer than you.\". And Green said: \"Yellow we just allow you to keep your impression of being important, actually you are no more than an indicator that one of us is coming, Red and me are doing the actual work here.\"\n\nNow Yellow was really furious. \"I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU ANYMORE!\" and jumped out of the traffic light. The cars were surprised about the missing Yellow between Green and Red, even the newspapers wrote about it. But after a couple of days they all got used to it and everything worked like normal. \"What was this Yellow all about?\" people asked.

Add to that a bunch of crises (war, economy, energy, immigration) plus a massive budget pinch (many problems can be ameliorated with money - if you have money).  \nPlus there is the political factor that being a small partner in a coalition (in this case the FDP) is very bad for voter acceptance, because you are constantly seen as compromising (or giving up on) your ideals, while government successes (if any) are mostly attributed to the major coalition partner.",
                "Basically at the last election the people voted for \"Anything but CDU and Armin Laschet\" and the result was a (by German standard's) very fractured Bundestag. \n\nSo they had to cobble together a three-way-coalition without actually having that much common ground to work with. \n\nPunchline is, the way the polls are looking, a re-election will only make that situation worse. There's no clear and easy majority in sight."

There's other geostrategic considerations at play here, like needing Sevastopol as at least one decent ice free harbor, albeit being in a shitty location, and the possession of Crimea being necessary to project power towards the Sea of Marmara, upgrading this harbor from \"useless wash\" to at least \"sub-optimal\", but those are secondary. Buffers is the one and only thing Russia can do to achieve at least some semblance of security in the geopolitical sense, so having buffers is non-optional for strategic survival.\n\nGermany on the other hand is not so hot on the idea. A sufficiently secure Russia via buffers and anchors at geographic barriers, able to manage internal threats with sufficient pressure, and access to open-ocean ports might very well be able to dominate the Eurasian landmass absolutely and perhaps even rise to a pretender for hegemony. \n\nNot wanting to be dominated by one another is kind of what nations *do*, so it is in Germany's interest for Russia NOT to achieve that security they seek.

            "text": "In 1994 the Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in accordance with the Budapest Memorandum.  The memorandum said\n\n\"The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine;\"\n\nConsidering that the Ukraine had the 3rd largest nuclear arsenal at the time, this was probably the biggest move towards nuclear non-proliferation ever.  Now that the Budapest memorandum has been rendered a useless piece of paper by Putin, Ukraine is probably franticly working towards reconstituting its nuclear arsenal.  They certainly have the material and knowledge to do so.   \n\nPer the wikipedia article on Ukraine nuclear weapons\n\"\nPavlo Rizanenko told USA Today that Ukraine may have to arm themselves with their own nuclear weapons if the USA and other world leaders don’t hold up their end of the agreement. He said “\"We gave up nuclear weapons because of this agreement. Now there's a strong sentiment in Ukraine that we made a big mistake.\"(http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/10/ukraine-\nnuclear/6250815/) [9] He also said that \"In the future, no matter how the situation is resolved in Crimea, we need a much stronger Ukraine. If you have nuclear weapons people don't invade you.\"(http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/the-ukraine-crisis-is-unsettling-decades-old-nuclear-weapons-agreements-20140312) [10]\n\"\nI would argue that Putin's move to reconstitute the Soviet union with Ukraine has probably in the long term reignited a nuclear arms race in Europe.  I think that the eastern european powers are working to acquire nuclear weapons given that Germany and France have no interest in protecting their borders against Russia.  Given that\n\n\"Germany receives over a third of its gas and oil from Russia and over 6,000 German firms are active there. A poll last week showed that a majority of Germans oppose sanctions against Russia. \"\n\nMy question is, do the German citizenry and government not realize the ramifications of their pursuit of short term economic goals vs the prospect a nuclear arms race in Europe?  Or do you not think that placating Putin will not have long term effects for the security of Europe?\n\nI think that what Germany and France are doing (or rather not doing) will rival the US War on Terror as one of biggest fuckups in the 21st century. Am I wrong?  \n\nI would propose that they take a hit on their economies as they progressively sever economic ties with Russia in exchange for long term security of Europe and nuclear proliferation world wide.

                "\"When goods are not crossing borders, armies do\"\n\nIt might be a simple saying, but there is a lot wisdom in it.\n\nLet me expand on that. Putin's aggression in Ukrain was done for domestic reasons. He created an atmosphere of hyper nationalism, to distract from domestic problems. That is pretty much like riding a tiger. You have to hold on for dear live or you get eaten. What has he archived? Almost nothing. While Crimea has some important naval bases, it is an economic wasteland and will need huge infrastructure investment to link it with Russia. Donetsk is somewhat more valuable. However, whatever those regions are worth in economic terms Putin over payed (maybe willingly for domestic reason). The removal of foreign investment capital by private companies alone made the whole thing a net loss. And while Germany might be dependent on Russian gas, Russia is even more dependent on German gas money. An invasion is just armed robbery on a grander scale. We willingly wire him more money, than he could ever hope to win by an invasion. Putin wont try to slaughter the goose that he depends on for golden eggs and therefore we will have peace. Unless we cut economic ties with Russia and remove the incentive not to start a war. \n\nAlso what you said about Ukrainian nuclear rearmament is idiotic. ",
                "The economic ties with Russia are a big problem, indeed. The government of Gerhard Schröder build up these ties as an attempt to get more independent from the USA. Now we see that Russia isn't the good partner our government thought it is. But it's difficult to loosen that ties in such a short period of time. An even bigger problem: The eastern EU-member-states do have even stronger ties with Russia. And they don't have such a strong economy. So if Germany and France sanction Russia even more, the eastern states could come in much trouble. ",
                "I don't see your argument. If the Ukraine decides to arm itself with nuclear weapons, it *will* arm itself with nuclear weapons, no matter what any EU member state does with respect to sanctions or other actions. \n\n> My question is, do the German citizenry and government not realize the ramifications of their pursuit of short term economic goals vs the prospect a nuclear arms race in Europe? \n\nFrance already has nuclear weapons. If you mean that Germany should also get nuclear weapons, well, if the Ukranians don't feel pretected by the French, they won't feel protected by the Germans, either.\n\nAnd BTW, the EU, including Germany, already has [decided](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/sanktionen-gegen-russland-eu-will-strafen-kommende-woche-absegnen-a-982916.html) to put sanctions against Russia into effect, it only needs to decide on the details. This will hurt Germany as much as it will hurt Russia, which is unfortunate, and it probably won't change Russia's stance at all, but at least it's gesture.\n\nIt's a difficult situation, and I don't see any ideal solution (and if I had one, I'd probably be a politician, and not posting on reddit). \n\nSevering economical ties with Russia, going back to nuclear power, and helping the US invade other countries to help US interests so they can play the biggest bully is definitely not a solution (and would make a lot things worse).\n"

Since I came to Germany as a refugee from Ukraine, not suddenly, but gradually I could see differences in my eating habits and some problems with my health. \nRight now I live at a refugee camp (moving out to a flat next week I hope) and here you can’t cook or even boil water for yourself, only at cafeteria at specified time, so I can only eat from there but I gotta say I did try to cook something myself a few times. The reason is no matter how much I eat my stomach is full but I feel hungry, and it’s not even only me. Ukrainian friends outside the camp I know have the same problems (even though they cook themselves as they said) and the people we ask in the camp said the same thing. My sister had an allergy and a few ppl I know had gastritis. I myself lost a lot of mass and right now I am close to being underweight. \nHas anyone encountered that once they’ve moved here? What did you do?\n Can someone maybe recommend nutrition deficiency tests (I think it’s called Mikronährstoffanalyse) to buy as well?\n\nEDIT: mostly a month passed, I still haven’t fixed my health problems completely, but I’ve moved to the flat already and cook myself. It feels a lot better although I do struggle to keep a balance because I have huge sugar cravings but I guess we’ll get there 😅. I feel more positive about the situation right now.

And some days, she gets a pretty upset stomach from it.\n\nPeople who cook en masse often use convenience products, with many additives, instead of cooking fresh. That isn't good for anyone long term.\n\nAbout testing for malnutrition, I think it would be a good idea to ask your doctor. If you're having issues, you most likely won't have to pay for it.\n\nIf more of the other refugees get tested and it turns out you have health issues because of the food, maybe you can change something for the people who'll have to stay there, or arrive after you. \n\nGood luck, and I hope you get better soon.",

Plus the US military presence in germany is a hot topic for both sides. The right don't like them because of a perceived loss of sovereignty and an objection to American hegemony. The left for more moral reasons regarding american imperialism and military actions in the middle east. Which are both very unpopular here in basically all walks of society. The immediate post ww2 generation of west germany usually has a rather positive opinion on the US as they remember the soldiers after the war. This generation is starting to die off though and younger people don't have these memories. In my personal experience the youth is getting, politically speaking, increasingly Anti-American. Culturally speaking the US has a huge influence over the western world. US media is consumed and well liked for the most part provided that \"it's not too American.\" Which is a phrase you do hear positively remarked about new Hollywood movies for example.",

That may be older than you, but older people -- those already past retirement age -- are much less likely to be involved in this kind of scene.\n\nBeing brought up with \"a huge influence of American culture\" isn't automatically going to make you less likely to be critical of the US. In fact, if you're the type to worry that the US is trying to eradicate your own culture, having American culture such a large part of your life is *more* likely to make you think that the US is pulling the strings.\n\nIt's not really hatred of the US per se, though, more a distrust of the current US \"regime\". Movements like Querdenker are closely related to such things as QAnon , which is an American movement. The idea is that the US is currently ruled by a \"corrupt elite\" which only Donald Trump can save us from.\n\nWe have been subjected to years -- decades even -- of Russian propaganda disseminated through social media that is effectively \"brainwashing\" large sections of the population to help destabilize our societies. Once you start convincing people that the problems they face are caused by more powerful people trying to oppress them -- and this is very easy to do, because it means they don't have to accept responsibility for their own predicaments -- you can make them believe any conspiracy theory you want.\n\nAnd since it's a \"powerful elite\" that's causing all the problems in the world, who is the most powerful elite there is? Why, it's the US government, of course.",

I feel like I can do basically nothing here. The Jobcenter isn't really active nor helpful, I often waited months to receive replies from administrations like this generally. Even for the Aufenthaltstitel I waited for 4 months to be done. So far, I received no assistance in finding a language course and I was already told, that I would have to pay a part of it myself.\n\nI have a Bachelor degree in English language and worked most of my time in IT sales and consulting.\n\nFor the past 8 months, I wrote a lot of applications and after some time (and a lot of rejections or simply ghosting) has passed, I even started applying for jobs as a production assistant (Produktionshelfer, Fabrik). Even there, where a lot of people without any qualifications or language skills seem to have found a job, I received no answer and/or rejections. From a friend who worked in HR I heard, that this is because I have a Bachelor's degree, so for them, I am basically overeducated. God, I even received a rejection on an application as a DISHWASHER. Like, am I not enough? 💀\n\nMy current German skills are more or less A2, but without practice and guidance (without the stress of using it in real situations all the time), this leads me nowhere.\n\nI am completely lost and depressed. After so much time, I slowly lose my purpose in life and advice would be much appreciated. Also, for context, I am living in a 300k people city, close to even bigger cities. I am not trying to find something in a village.",

Check LinkedIn and see which companies are located in your town/around you: visit the Careers page and check once a week if new openings are available. You can also make a list of companies that hire remotely.\n\nIt's a tough market at the moment, but not as bad as last year. Imo, here will always be positions available in CS or Support - people in those departments change quite often their jobs. You just need to enter somewhere and stay there for \\~1-2 years.

Don't put your degree in your CV when you apply for these jobs.\n\n  \nWhat I observed from ppl who never got replies from hundred of job application is that they don't know how to write CV (or don't care much to adapt CV to each job application). I'd recommend to work on this. Don't just send out 100 copied CV. You just need 10 of very targeted and tailored CV.\n\n  \nAnd in the mean time, push your German to B1. You will have to pay 25% for the Integrationkurs (75% covered by BAMF), but if you are still under JobCenter's cover, you don't have to care much about this money (it's 200eu anyway).",

Going to the extent to target journalist covering the story with charges of market manipulation.  Olaf was in charge of BaFin at the time and the ultimate head of Germany's financial oversight authority during the Wirecard scandal. \n\nLawmakers did previously accuse BaFin of protecting Wirecard, namely as mentioned above by imposing a ban on short-selling a year prior to the scandal unfolding. He got grilled heavily and was the focus of a lot of media attention. \n\nSo given this, and obviously the events of this week, how do regular germans view Olaf both prior to the Ukraine conflict and now?

                "A lot of Germans wanted Merkel, so with her gone they went to the next best thing, and of all people Scholz is closest to Merkel in temperament.",
                "One thing you have to understand about virtually all of his scandals is that they always affected him only indirectly.\n\nTake Wirecard, for example: as finance minister, Scholz had political oversight of the Bafin authority. But that does not mean that Wirecard's documents passed directly over Scholz's desk. Scholz only has political responsibility, if any. Imagine you are the head of a huge authority apparatus and a scandal happens in one of the 50 sub-departments. Are you, as the boss, responsible for it? Maybe. But are you to blame? Probably not.\n\nI can absolutely understand that there are people who say that Scholz should have taken responsibility for it, but at the same time the same applies to other politicians, including Merkel. Also her government was often absolutely overwhelmed (as an example you could mention the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, which completely failed in 2015 - And I don't mean the decision of accepting refugees, but the refugee intake and the failure of the authority).",
                "Well we didn't vote for him per se, we voted for his party. Most voters care less about the chancellor and far more about the party as they will be the decision makers in the Bundestag. However the candidate and the party are of course intertwined as the candidate usually doubles as the most senior spokesman of the party during the campaign. Considering the campaign that followed was an absolute shitshow with every major candidate getting some dirt at some point, Scholz was arguably the cleanest of the bunch. Apart from a minor side roll in that wire card affair there aren't even any other scandals I could recall. It also helps that he is a clean slate in more than one way. He didn't really take sides with extreme opinions and rarely shows emotion. I think he's a bit like a water cooker. He's there, he's pragmatic and he makes noises. There isn't really much to like about him but there also isn't much to dislike. That being said the Ukraine crisis is shaping Scholz' public perception massively right now. So far he hasn't deviated much from what I've said but that might change in the coming weeks."

Before graduation my highschool diploma was rejected by my university and my medical diploma has been on hold since then. I don’t want to go into details because the post isn’t about that. I have passed every exam including both the KROK 1 and KROK 2 which is like USMLE 1 and 2 but for Ukraine. But I have no medical diploma to show for. I am In Germany now and it greatly hurts me to see all my knowledge go to waste. What are my options right now? Is there any way I can utilize my knowledge to get a good job? Is there any job that requires medical knowledge but no medical diploma? \nP.s. I am working in Back-Factory right now.",

If you wait 18 months and then get a negative feedback and start to learn for Kenntnisprüfung, it'll be a lot of time wasted.\n\n\nI know this is a frustrating process, be sure to call your contact person at the Landesamt regularly to ask for updates.\n\n\nEdit: If you sent it to your contact person at the Landesamt, they will send it to the Gutachtenstelle für Gesundheitsberufe (GfG) in Bonn. Definitely ask your contact person if they already forwarded your documents to the GfG. Only then it's in the waiting queue for Prüfung auf Gleichwertigkeit (that's when the 18 months start) ",

Would really love some help or any sort of direction to figure out the taxes in Germany.\n\nSo I've been living in Germany for almost three years now, as a Ukrainian refugee. I've been officially employed for almost 2 years, and all of my taxes have been sorted by the German employer. \n\nBut about 6 months ago I switched to freelancing out of necessity; notified the Jobcenter and registered as a freelancer with Finanzamt (feeling rather stupid, but actually had to go there in person to figure out how to do that). As well, I created an account on ELSTER.\n\nTechnically, I have just one \"client\" that I send an invoice to monthly, so I have a fixed retainer.  \n\nNow, the whole idea of taking care of taxes is rather dreadful and scary to me, but I failed to find any service or accountant that would \"take care\" of that for me. I did find some people that were paying taxes here as freelancers, and they told me that it happens yearly, and not quarterly like in Ukraine. \n\nBut as time goes on, I am growing more and more worried of making a mistake and not being quite sure how to pay these income taxes. I was wondering whether someone could please recommend me any services that help freelancers, or could guide me through the forms?\n\nI started filling them out and am not completely sure I am doing the right ones.

I've been living here for about 6 months, and I like this country. I improved my German to B2 (when I moved, I already had A1-A2), found an Ausbildung als Anwendungsentwickler, and have continued working on my german, skills etc.  \nHowever, the only problem I have is quite significant for me personally: I'm here alone in a small city. All my friends, my family and close people are in Ukraine, I haven't found any friends here yet. And it actually makes no sense because I'll move to Köln for my Ausbildung in 3 months, and I plan on improving my social life there.  \nBut I really miss my friends, my family and my hometown in Ukraine. I feel extremely lonely, and it doesn't feel right to live a life like this at 18. I understand that I would be happy in Ukraine for the next 2 or maybe 3 years, but then I'll probably suffer or may get killed, since I honestly don't see an end of war.  \nHere in Germany, I'm suffering now and will suffer probably for the next 3 month. I really hope, that my social life will improve when I move to Köln. I also understand, of course, that I should be grateful that my family and I are still alive and that we still have everything we need to live a normal life, except the constant thread to get killed.  \n\n\nMaybe some of you, especially older ones, have some advice for me? Any thoughts on all this?  I feel like I'm still kid who desperately needs to have a friends in real life, not just online. I'm proud of myself, that I manage all the house work, german bureaucracy stuff, learning new language, skills. Yet, I don't feel happy, and I understand that these are supposed to be the best years of my life. I still don't know if moving here was the right decision. I also lost my first real adult relationship, which was extremely warm and great for both of us. As mentioned earlier, any advice would be truly valuable for me.",

                "Fellow Ukrainian here, twice your age, living in Germany for 10+ years. \n\nHere are a few random points from the top of my head:\n\n- 3 months might feel like a long time when you are 18, because literally the ratio of 3 months to your total lived months is bigger than when you are, let's say 30. It's a valid perception at your age, but also look at it this way: it's just 3 months. Not years. You can absolutely do it.\n\n- \"Best years of your life\" is probably not a total bs, but also not entirely true. I think it puts too much pressure on young people. I found my late twenties to be much better, compared to 18. I started earning decent money, could afford traveling, got a little more life experience, started understanding myself and my needs better, etc. Now in my thirties I think they are better than my late twenties. Where I am getting at: it's all relative. Don't beat yourself up. You do you. Just show up to the world, be open to people and events - even if some of those most likely will fuck you over - and you will not regret it later.\n\n- I would recommend spending the time before Köln doubling down on the language really hard - this will open many social doors for you in Köln once you move.\n\n- I would also recommend picking an activity if you don't have one already. Preferably a team sport, or something creative that can be done in a group. Learn to do/play it a little bit and join a club/meetup/group in Köln for it, as soon as you move.\n\n- I know this one might sound silly at first, but hear me out: volunteer to a nearby elderly house, speak to people there, read them a book. It will give you yet another perspective in life, you will not feel as lonely, they will not feel as lonely, your language will improve. It's a win-win.\n\n- You are already doing great being so independent and strong (even if it's not 100% by your own choice). Fill your alone time with useful activities that will propel you even further later: learn to cook healthy meals for yourself, exercise - especially if you feel shitty and down, call your friends in Ukraine, take walks outside.",
                "At my work there are a couple of Ukrainians kids and what you describe rings familiar to how they feel / tell uns how they feel. Important first and foremost is to not beat yourself on your head: There is no reason to feel bad about your situation. Everybody can have feelings of isolation - better situated people with less difficult backgrounds have them, too. You having an Ausbildung and living here is the best you can do and probably also the best thing anyone could wish for your safety and for your current life prospects. Feeling conflicted about that is normal.\n\nSecondly: Being in a professional education and finishing it is a great starter for your future. If you like it, persue your Ausbildung.  As I said, I regularly talk to other kids feeling the same. **You** being safe and working on a educational and professional future either here that can either make here your new home or you can take back home to Ukraine to use it there is everything a loved one could wish for you. See it as a chance to use for yourself and others rather than a happy circumstance you haven't earned. \n\nThirdly: Social isolation is a thing and espescially in small cities it can be dreadfull. Your move to a big city like Cologne you have many more opportunities to meet people. However, it also is a big city and big cities can be more anonymous and isolating. The \"trick\" in Germany to get to know people, espescially if you are not in school anymore or not \"clicking\" with your peers at school is to look out for activities, groups, clubs whatever where people share their common interests. As an Azubi your financial means in that regard is of course limited, but you can still go on the lookout for what your are interested in and would like to pursue with others. Amateur sports? Your urban gardening group? There is surprisingly a lot going on around you if you start looking.\n\nAlso, Jugendzentren and such are available and ready to be checked out.\n\nLastly: While I understand the \"best years of my life\" line of thinking - these \"best years\" easily extend from mid tens to at least late twenties - you have plenty of time left for everything that would make these years \"the best\". It is clear that the current situation is dire, don't have a shadow looming over it due to some cliché of \"best years\" - every year in your life can be the best when things are sorted out.",

While she’s not competing in international math contests, math comes naturally to her, and she finds it easy.\n\nWe always assumed she would study for a STEM degree at a local technical university, even though many of her classmates plan to go to Germany.

I find it difficult to guide her on what’s best for her future. Should she focus on computer science or engineering? And after completing her degree, would it be better to pursue academia or focus on building a career in a corporation?\n\nThe main question is: Is it worth pursuing a bachelor’s program in English in Germany, or would it be better to complete a bachelor’s degree at a top Polish technical university and then pursue a master’s degree abroad? From what I understand, there’s a wide range of master’s programs in English across Europe.\n\nBonus question: We also looked into the UK, but with tuition fees and living costs, the total cost of a STEM degree there could reach $70,000 USD for 3.5 years. Is it worth considering this option when studying in mainland Europe would be significantly more affordable?\n\nThank you in advance for any advice!\n\n",

                "Software engineer with 18 years of experience and a CS background here. I also really like CS and programming, so I'm obviously biased.\n\nI would say she should study CS. While there still aren't as many women working in the field as some other STEM fields (ex: chemistry and biology), there are more than in engineering. The career paths are also more flexible, especially for women. If she plans to have children at some point, working as a software engineer is far more flexible than most fields, especially since COVID. There are plenty of mostly or even fully remote jobs that make having a family later on way easier. I know it has for me as a father.\n\nThe first few years after graduation can be a grind, but I think that is common for a lot of fields. Once she has some experience and skills under her belt, it becomes a lot easier, and with the shift to remote working she can have a very comfortable life.\n\nI personally would advise her to pursue a career in industry. Not that academia isn't rewarding, but it's a lot easier to find \"interesting\" jobs that tickle her intellect than it is to find interesting jobs in academia. It doesn't hurt that working in industry also pays a lot more. I would also not focus on large corporations. Nothing wrong there per se, but especially in the beginning of her career, working at small companies (even though they tend to be much more demanding) can provide a lot more learning and experience building new products than at large corporations where most jobs are maintaining existing ones.\n\nI think most European universities do a decent job teaching CS. Poland seems to have a vivid software engineer industry, and from my experience, the Polish software engineers I've worked with were quite good. So, while I don't know any specifics about Polish universities, they seem to do a good job graduating good software engineers.\n\nAgain, my opinion biased, so take it for what it is.",

Have you asked what she wants from her life?\n\nI come from a place where people often study not the fields they want to study, but the \"fanciest\" or best paying field they can get into, and that ends up leaving them unhappy, and generally makes interacting with them less pleasant (say with doctors, you're often seen as a necessary interaction for them to make their paycheck, not as a patient that they're passionate about helping).\n\nAbout computer science, well, I find it that what is taught in universities on CS courses is not very representative of real life software engineering jobs. There's value in it for sure, but I wouldn't spend 70k USD on it for myself.\n\nAnyhow: Consider Italy, I believe they have cheaper tuition, cheaper cost of life, and English courses.

Also we live in a tiny village so it is not as fun and romantic as some people think. It’s a hard work, and it lacks open sea. It’s worth mentioning that we are very grateful and loyal to Germany for its’ help in war effort and relocation so in long term we plan to assimylate. Assymilate Asimilate ass- how do you write this word? Anyway, you got it. Cheers, AAAH PROST. ",

It also depends on which city you will be sent to.\n\nIf you have family or friends who can help you then the process will be 10x easier compared to the regular process. You will be provided housing if you cant find one yourself, but it wont necessarily be a nice place. Usually wherever they have enough space, they send you. You get immediately registered at the social services and they send your info to the foreigners authority aka Auslanderbbehorde. They also provide you with funds if you have none so you can purchase food/clothes, around 300-400€. Once at your place of stay, you'll have to wait anywhere between 1-3 months before they issue you a permit. \n\nPlenty of jobs available but the issue every foreigner faces here is the language. The faster you can learn to speak, the better the chances for you to get employed. Bigger cities have more opportunities and smaller cities usually have jobs in places like fast food joints or warehouses, etc \n\nIt takes on average 3-8 months to learn to understand and speak basic german and having small conversations. Took me 5 months to get to B1 level while it took 10 months for my partner. So it also depends on you. You will be sponsored by the Jobcenter for the integration course the first time, meaning you dont have to pay. Once all this is done, they also help you find a job in your profession and also other jobs that might fit your skillset. \n\nThe best advice i can give you is to find some telegram groups of Ukrainians in Germany. First hand experiences and advice specifically for your situation will be there. If you don't know of any, dm me and I'll share the link of one i know of. I can also share it here but im not sure whether its allowed. \n\nThe German system is excellent but you have to be patient and do your own research as well for it to work properly.

But I have a refugee residence permit, and I might need to switch to a student visa, which may impact my case.\n\nHow can I change IKK Classic before I start my doctorate? And once I have a student visa, can I actually switch to Mawista?",

            "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ie3gr9/how_can_i_help_a_troubled_teenage_ukrainian/",
            "text": "Hello. My situation is rather complicated. This post is probably going to be long and poorly organized, I apologize in advance.\n\nI'm a Ukrainian refugee myself, and I've been living in Hesse for almost 3 years now. My German is still not very good (B1 level), but I'm fluent in English. I live here together with my mom, but I am an adult.\n\nA few months ago I befriended a 15 year old girl through happenstance (her mom and mine went to the same Deutschkurs class). She is also a Ukrainian refugee and lives nearby, together with her mom. Her German knowledge is almost nil; despite that, she is somehow expected to attend a normal German school like every other teenager. She's given up on even trying to learn the language, has zero interest in studying, doesn't even pretend to pay attention in class, and straight up skips school more often than not. Her mother has received numerous warnings and fines because of this, and it continues to be a constant source of strife between them.\n\nBut that's really not the root of the problem, just a small manifestation of it. To give some background, this girl had a really fucked up upbringing. Her dad is a hopeless alcoholic and a drug addict. Back In Ukraine, the four of them — her, her mom, her dad, and her older brother — used to live together in a single room, because the rest of the apartment was always full of trash (google hoarder nest to get the idea). She was physically (and maybe even sexually) abused by her dad and brother, while her mom worked multiple jobs to make ends meet and had no time (or so she claims) to devote any attention to the children. Because of that, they never learned how to communicate with each other. By age 10 this girl was already a heavy drinker and smoker, and she's still addicted to cigarettes to this day. She ran away from home many times, made multiple suicide attempts, and her body is covered with scars from self-harm. She's been admitted to a psychiatric hospital a few times.\n\nFast forward to the present, the home situation in Germany is obviously better: they have a nice social apartment, there are only 2 people in it, and the girl finally has her own room… but it's a far cry from sunshine and rainbows. Her relationship with her mom is incredibly toxic. There's no trust or understanding between them at all. Basically the only times they 'talk' is when her mom shouts orders or random caustic complaints at her. The mom frequently tells her stuff like \"there is not a single good or respectable thing about you\" (this one was uttered in front of me). The girl is expected (never *asked*) to do house chores as a matter of \"respect\" for her elder, yet never gets any encouragement or respect in return. The mom doesn't seem to understand — or care, really — that school is a pointless waste of time for her daughter due to the language barrier, she just expects her to attend for the sake of attending. In fact, she seems to treat her more like some automaton that's supposed to follow a set program, rather than a human being with her own desires, feelings, and aspirations.\n\nThe girl has two sources of entertainment in her life: her half-broken phone and a few friends she hangs out with. Naturally, the punishment for any infraction (which can range from skipping school to letting a friend use the shower) is usually a week of house arrest and/or confiscation of the phone. The girl's usual reaction to everything, no matter how unreasonable, is a quiet \"ok\" followed by a swift retreat into her room. She has long since learned that nothing ever comes out of arguing, so she just tries to minimize any contact with her mom. The punishments are, of course, never effective in discouraging future \"offenses\".\n\nRecently she got punished with a \"forever house arrest\" for skipping 2 days of school: she is not allowed to hang out with friends anymore, ever. Only school and staying home from now on. I don't know how the mom expects this to hold up. The girl is complying for now, but isn't going to keep it up and has already expressed to me a desire to run away from home.\n\nI'm omitting a lot of stuff here, but this post would be 10 times longer if I hadn't. In my view, this relationship is unsalvageable. The two harbor metric fucktons of deep seated resentment for each other, and neither is interested in letting it go. At some point a \"family preservation center\" (I don't know the German name; translated from Russian word-for-word) offered both of them therapy to mend their relationship. The girl rejected it. She has stated many times, in no uncertain terms, that all she wants is to get the fuck away from her mother and that she would rather live in an orphanage. At some point she told me, paraphrasing a bit, \"I hope mom just beats me up already so I can report it and get taken away\". Her mother's sentiment is hard to evaluate because she contradicts herself all the time, but she too has spoken about her daughter as if she's a tiresome burden on her.\n\nI'm not related to this girl at all, but at this point I'm the only adult in her life whom she trusts. I really care about her and want to help her somehow. Despite everything, she is remarkably smart, introspective, and generally a good person (none of which I can say about her mother), who is set on a path toward destruction by the shitty circumstances around her. Is there anything that I could do for her?",

Normally you would have to do Studienkolleg first, but apparently under certain conditions you can skip this, if you already studied abroad. Here is the situation: In Ukraine, she finished school, which is only 11 years there, then studied medicine there and dropped out and later enrolled at a different university to study psychology and is still technically enrolled there. To make matters more complicated, she got married and divorced while keeping her ex-husbands name, so her name on some of the documents is not the same as her name now.\n\n\n\nAs far as we would understand, the medicine study would let her study medicine and only medicine here in Germany, but the psychology study might enable her to study anything that is consideres \"Geisteswissenschaften\".\n\n\n\nBut here is the frustrating part: She has been telling this to different universities in order to ask if she can study without Studienkolleg under these circumstances and if so, which fields she would be able to study. All of them answered something like \"Sounds complicated, just send us all your documents, translated to German of course, and then we can answer\". She estimated that getting all relevant documents translated would cost around 1000€! This is not the kind of money you want to spend just to find out you have to do Studienkolleg anyway and if only some of them would need to be translated that would be very good to know anyway.

I've been actively studying German for some time already, and by my tutor's estimations, it is realistic to have a very solid A2, and beginner(for bragging that I'm B1:)) B1 by the time I get to study there, which is pretty good I think for starters.\n\nHere are the links to this program, maybe someone will be interested in looking over them:\n\n[https://vilniustech.lt/studies/study-programmes/master-study-programmes/317411?element\\_id=317413&sp\\_id=77\\_pr\\_2025&f\\_id=9&qualification=a%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A1%3A%22M%22%3B%7D](https://vilniustech.lt/studies/study-programmes/master-study-programmes/317411?element_id=317413&sp_id=77_pr_2025&f_id=9&qualification=a%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A1%3A%22M%22%3B%7D)\n\n[https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/fmb/international/double-degree-programmes/vilnius-lithuania](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/fmb/international/double-degree-programmes/vilnius-lithuania)\n\nI'd be grateful for any help, maybe someone also finished this type of double degree, or knows something about it, or can point me where to read up on it more:)\n\nThanks!",

I was very moved when I saw 3 individuals with down syndrome wearing little cowboy hats, they were arriving from the train station. Furthermore, I was very moved by what I saw, it was a bit alien to me to see people with the condition so carefree and with the right environment. I came back to Ukraine very disappointed as to realize that we as a part of greater country that helped defeat Nazism could not take good care of our disabled children. After that I lived in Berlin in Rathnau Spandau where I had summer practice for Siemens. Now my whole family is in Germany. My mother, father, half-brother are all there. I'm in Ukraine, and maybe I will go there to be reunited with my family when time comes. Father was operated by German doctors since he is a soldier, and we are waiting for him to get a prosthetic. Mother is learning language and says Germany is a holy country on how they treat refugees, my brother also is learning language.

Volunteering is very widespread, so it's up to you to find the field where you would like to help out but your help will certainly be welcome wherever you choose to go. As for a career, there are very different fields; like you need to get a different education to become a therapist for example than if you want to become a supervisor in a sheltered workshop and so on. Maybe once you are back in Germany, you could ask for a Berufsberatung at Arbeitsagentur to get an overview what jobs are available and what path you need to take to get there.",

We have been together for about a year now and we currently don't live together yet. She would like to stay in Germany in order to stay with me. Her right to live in Germany is currently based on § 24 AufenthG, which, as far as we understand, can't be extended beyond March of 2025. So the important question is: How do we prevent her from having to return to Ukraine next year?\n\nIt is questionable if we can get her an other kind of visa in time, so we are considering to get married earlier than we normally would want to under normal circumstances, so that she can stay here. One thing that complicates that is that when she came here she was still technically married to her now-ex-husband in Ukraine but since then got divorced during a visit of her homeland. We are still working on getting the divorce certificate translated by a German translater (we actually already have a German translation from Ukraine but the Bürgeramt doesn't accept it). If I understand correctly, we will even need a \"Ehefähigkeitszeugnis\" from Ukraine? I'm not sure how easy it will be to get that. And apparently we will need birth certificates that are no older than 6 months, so we will need to get new ones even if we don't have them yet?\n\nI heard that it is easier to do this in Denmark. Would you recommend that we do this instead? We aren't sure yet if dealing with an other country will be worth the effort?\n\nTo make matters more complicated, we would like to have a prenuptial agreement, which may or may not change the answer yet again.\n\nIf the Bundesland matters, we live in Hessen.\n\nMaybe we even overlooked a completely different option. Anyway, we would be very grateful if anyone could get us advice on what we should do and what we should prioritize for the preparations.",

Ask your Sachbearbeiter what they need and how long it takes to get a wedding date. You might want to have that option at hand, through. \n\nDenmark is easier and there are even agencies offering their help. Maybe enquire one or two. To check the costs and duration if the procedure. You will need a Trauzeuge by law in Denmark, but close to the border there is actually a Hochzeitstourismus and you can hire someone to do so.

            "text": "So I have 2 Ukrainian guests, a mother and her 13 year-old son. They are both really lovely and good people and very easy guests, always quiet and considerate. My only problem is that I suspect the boy has been file sharing and it is very illegal here in Germany and often prosecuted. I gave them the wifi password when they arrived a month ago. They were so exhausted and probably stunned by what they had to go through in the weeks before they left Ukraine, that I never thought for a minute about any potential wifi problems. I just realized today that the boy now has a laptop - he didn't have it when he arrived but they received a parcel from home last week that apparently contained it. I noticed he had it  because he was sitting somewhere close to the router and he explained that it was easier for him to download big files if he sits closer to the router than in his room. Later that night the wifi went out briefly, not a big deal, but suddenly it popped into my head that maybe he was file sharing. It turns out that he does indeed normally do that extensively in Ukraine, he told me that no one he knows can afford Netflix and that torrenting is not illegal and everyone does it often. However, he said that he didn't do it while he was here. I asked him how he can be sure because afaik torrenting programs often operate on startup and he said no it was not possible because he checks the task manager on his PC... but I'm not really convinced. Also he has a phone.\n\nSo I have 2 questions: (1) if he has been torrenting here on my wifi, how much trouble am I in? (2) And is there anything I can do to prevent file sharing on my router? I mean, without just kicking him off the wifi. I don't believe he would do it intentionally now that I've explained to him that it's illegal and asked him not to, but he is just a kid and might accidentally start downloading a game or something in the way he is used to without thinking about it. He and his mom absolutely need wifi right now as they try to set up their new lives so blocking their wifi access would be really harsh. Thank you for any help you can give me.",

VPNs are worth paying for, especially in a circumstance such as yours.",

                "First of all, torrenting isn't necessarily illegal. The torrenting of files without the permission of the copyright owner *is* illegal (and is just as illegal in Ukraine as it is in Germany, it's just that in Germany there are often consequences thanks to the almighty power of the Abmahnung). Also note that merely downloading is unlikely to have any consequences: the reason torrenting can get you into trouble is that it involves re-uploading the stuff you are downloading, which counts as distribution.\n\nSecondly, illegal file sharing is very rarely prosecuted. It is nearly always treated as a civil matter: the worst that can usually happen is that you get an Abmahnung with a demand to pay a three-figure sum. If that happens you should probably get in touch with a lawyer, because as I understand it the costs can sometimes be reduced.\n\nUnfortunately, this is one of those risks you assume when you take on guests of any kind, and when these guests are war refugees it's a risk you can't in all good conscience pass back to them.\n\nGiving the boy access to your Netflix/Amazon Prime/whatever you have might help. Or -- and I realize this is a big ask and probably not possible -- engaging with the family more to keep the boy occupied and distracted with lots of fun activities should also make it less likely that he'll want to stare at his laptop all day.\n\nAt this point you'll have to give him the benefit of the doubt. If a nasty letter does arrive from a lawyer, you'll have to have a conversation with the boy and his mother, but you should probably be understanding about it in a \"no hard feelings but please don't do it again\" kind of way. He's 13, he is capable of some degree of responsibility, and you'll just have to show him a little trust."

She found out her previous -illegal- attempt wasn't possible, so she's jumped to another equally baseless idea to inflict pain and get her way.\n\nI believe you have a Fiktionswirkung for your visa due to the fact that your visa is submitted and in processing. The Fiktionswirkung is effectively a benefit of the doubt type of thing, they assume you'll be approved and so you're allowed to stay until a decision is reached, as long as you have paperwork showing that you submitted for the visa. Any major changes, **such as address should you move from the registered property**, need to be reported to the office processing your paperwork, along with changes in eligibility.\n\nYou need to talk to a series of lawyers I'm afraid. Aside from the likely need for a divorce lawyer, you need to contact an immigration lawyer. An immigration lawyer will be able to help you navigate this process and situation far better than anyone here on reddit.",

He was in a civil partnership with his ex, who cheated on him and also tried to get him deported while he was still on a yearly permit. He had to pay for the divorce and immigration attorneys and therapist etc. After a year, he won the case and got the right to remain in the country and now has the permanent residency and is on the process of becoming a German citizen.",

This is not very believable though since you live together with her in the same apartment. (Still, be prepared for this potential move.) \n\nNormally the German authorities would first need to investigate her claims, this is where you can and should try to stop this and present it for what it is: a genuine marriage that has gone nasty and where one spouse fights dirty. Might be smart to send a letter stating this in advance, but talk to a lawyer first.  \n\nEven in the worst case scenario if she does the above and the German authorities believe her and revoke your residency permit, you will usually have time to pack up bc the German authorities will tell you to leave by date X. Date X being several weeks in the future and you can fight this decision with a lawyer. \n\nIn regards to your application for permanent residency, I would definitely see a lawyer and talk to the lawyer about the possibility of an Untätigkeitsklage. You have a legal right to a response within 90 days, that your application has not been processed since 2022 is not acceptable. \n\nWith permanent residency you would be safe from any stuff your spouse might pull.",

Meanwhile we are enjoying lifestyle here and accessibility to Hannover with lots of possibilities for education and recreation we miss 2 important things: the snow (and skiing) and 7-9 hours of drive to the sea (Italy/Croatia). We explored Harz Park but it is not what we want for sport (but it is awesome for rest and biking).\n\nAnother concern is allergy - seems that a lot of seasonal pollen here and it affects my lungs from May to August.\n\nSo I am as a software dev (with remote work) looking for another city in South, B or BW Bundesland. At the moment I am collecting information for further estimates.\n\n1. How is the schools quality there? I've read that Bayern schools are good. Should I look for something specific or just any public elementary school will be good? (In case I will settle in city with at least 50k citizens).\n\n2. How is the pollen factor? Did anybody experienced it already? Based on SILAM models [https://silam.fmi.fi/pollen.html](https://silam.fmi.fi/pollen.html) Bayern is much better, I checked it over the year regularly. And during my summer vacations my health was much better near Alps even without medications.\n\n3. I selected few small cities like Hildesheim: Rosenheim, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Kempten, Linday, Friedrichshafen, Konstanz, Radolfzell, Singen. So all of them are mainly in the vicinity of the mountains. How are these cities in terms of various preparatory lessons? Like German classes for foreign kids, some sport, painting, math classes.\n\nMay be the question 3 is most important and this is direct consequence of our childhood in Ukraine (we've lived in a big city with almost 1.500.000 inhabitants so we are still adapting to de-centralized Germany). In case we miss something in education here in Hannover we can easily fill gaps with additional courses and classes or if the kid just tells us that \"hey this is important for me and I know to want more\".\n\nLooking forward for any comments/advices :)",

No one else wanted this, including his entire staff, for a number of complex reasons, not least of which was that the state wasn't called \"Germany\", but (the) \"German empire / realm\". Another big factor was that the title Willhelm wanted would have emphasized a rather unitary view of the new state, whereas all the kings and dukes and counts (and archdukes, and...) that made up it's territory were suddenly big on distribution of power. They preferred the title \"German Emperor\" - \"Deutscher Kaiser\".\n\nWhile the latter would eventually come about in practice, the dispute hadn't yet been solved at the actual coronation.

First of all, I greatly thank Germany and germans for help, housing, welfare, healthcare, I am having a blast (dumb pun but okay), we don’t have any of it in Ukraine, unless in tiny bits, and it does not work. \nI am really happy to be here now, and not on a frontline anymore, my loyalty and recognition stands with country I stay at. \nBut as any refugee I struggle to find any friends or actually my networking is garbage. \n\nI have seen many ukrainian refugees but they are not very… positive of female wounded war vet, as I guess it makes them feel uh, less good? I don’t know, my psychiatrist says it is normal for refugees to generally (not always) hate or dislike soldiers from they own country because of guilt they feel. I don’t blame them! \nI am not entitled to respect or acknowledgement anyway. But still I feel very lonely and abandoned in a way, which is very hard. Germans are nice people, despite all the bias foreigners may have, I am 10 months, close to 11 months in Germany, and so far I only had positive experience of Germans, but somewhat negative experience of Ukrainians and actually migrants from Eastern Europe. Not even that they don’t like idea of having female war vet next door, but they are very critical of a fact that I live with other woman, now it is complicated, my wife identifies as non binary, but you got the point, most people don’t care, they just think we are lesbians and thus steer clear or say mean stuff. \nGermans accept it. Eastern Europeans don’t. \n\nNow I really miss service and I struggled my best to get back to army but I failed miserably. Of course army was terrible, but it was my bread and butter, my spicy life and my big time gambling. Life in Germany is calm, I like it. But I miss all the emotions I felt as riflewoman, combat medic, machine gun operator and even drone pilot, and I am not flexing, I just say army was my LIFE, my identity, my routine. Something similar to all-green. I am addicted to gambling if you catch my drift. I have tried finding groups or communities for ex military in Germany, but because I speak only A1 level of German I am not very good at searching. \nAs for Ukrainian groups - they fit my partner more, because these groups are for women who are military spouses. I will be blue there and I don’t want to face hate from my ex countrymen/countrywomen. So I don’t know. \n\nAre there any groups, communities, organisations for ex military to chill together, crack a beer, get some therapy (my leg still hurts), do hunting, actually I would love to go to shooting range, fishing, just watch some movies or sentimental stuff? If not, what about just being friends? I don’t care if you are Balkan war veteran, USA veteran, Ukrainian veteran or German veteran etc. You might be as young as my sorry ass or in your late 90s I don’t care about age or origin. After all, those who served and especially those who got bonked hard, share too much in common, despite nationality and age. \nI don’t really care if they are homophobic or smth, I am Ukrainian, I can handle it. \nthe only thing I would ask is to consider me “a bro” and not a-girl-to-have-sex-with and take me as serious as you would take a man. Humour is absolutely fine, but saying or hinting I am not real vet because girls are rare and have it easier in army is a taboo.  \n—-\nPlease, no jokes about WW2, I am serious and desperate in my search. \nI live down south in Wurtt So not far from Ulm, Munich, Stuttgard Stu Sthugr Shtr I give up near the capital of Baden Wurttemberg.",

I even tried to learn some ukrainian but...uhm... it's дуже важко 😅.\n\nNow to answer your question: as you can probably imagine, due to historical reasons the relationship betweem germans and *anything* military is... complicated. So there really isn't much in terms of \"veteran life\". You best bet might be to look around bundeswehr circles but, in 99% of cases you'll be the only one with any combat experience.\n\nIt also depends a lot on what city you are in.

            "text": "Hello hello! On September 2021 I moved to Germany, and I lived in an apartment until March 2024, when I left since I moved to Sweden. On my floor there were three units: my apartment, another one where nobody lived because it was being furnished, and the third unit, which was the real estate agency office together with the apartment where the owner of the office lived with his wife. When I moved in to the apartment in October 2021, I had to sign up myself a contract with the electricity company, using the meter ID that the real estate agency proxying the landlord gave me. For almost two years, I was so pleased with the very affordable bills I was paying, especially taking into account the Ukraine war and its impact on German electricity prices. \n\nBut on September 2023 (almost two years after moving in and signing up the electricity contract), we got new neighbors on the apartment which had been empty, and who had to sign up an electricity contract too. Apparently there was some issue with the meters IDs and the electric company, so some electricians came to the building and found out that for the three units in my floor, there were only two meters: one for the apartment which had been empty so far, and another for my apartment together with the real estate office and the connected apartment. So yes, I had been paying so far for the empty apartment... Apparently this happened because in 2018 there were some reconstruction works which changed the so far existing two units into three.\n\nThe real estate agency said they would install a meter in their unit, and then calculate with that which percentage of each invoice I had to pay. But March 2024 came, I left Germany and the apartment, and they hadn't installed a meter yet. By mistake I forgot to cancel the automatic rental transfer in my bank, so I paid April by mistake. Just after a few weeks they returned me the deposit (3 times the \"cold\" rental), but did not pay me back the extra month. When I asked them about this, they said that they were retroactively calculating my electricity costs, and that once they did the numbers, they would pay it back. \n\nI told them that it's impossible by any means to retroactively calculate that. They came up with the idea of distributing the costs based on the square meters, and I told them this was completely wrong, as I lived alone and during 2023 spent more than 16 weeks abroad, or that I did not use my oven or had a drying machine. Nevertheless, it's been more than six months since I left and they haven't returned the money back, and they have come up now with their own calculations claiming that I owe them €90 on top of that extra paid month, but that they're fine with leaving it as it is, that means, not returning me the rental month and closing this matter.\n\nI feel completely fooled, and living now in Sweden, completely tied up (and they're probably aware of that). I think this is abusive and completely ilegal, especially because they did return the deposit. I have thought of suing them, but living abroad it will be much more complicated, and the lawyer and legal costs will exceed a lot the money they actually owe me.\n\nWhat is your opinion on this matter, what do you recommend me to do? Is there any entity in Germany that can assist me in this matter? Have you had any similar experience?",

In a hospital setting, there is lots of communication and lots of documentation. You will be seen as vastly more competent if your German is top notch and grammatical mistakes are rare.

If the German market is so much in urgent need for IT Professional, do I suck that much, that the German Markt is always refusing me or what?

Have you considered sharing your CV with the Job Center or seeking advice from German or Ukrainian colleagues already established in the field in Germany? The composition of your CV and motivation letter holds significant weight and differs a lot for what you got used to in Ukraine, down to the very photo you choose to include. While some Ukrainian CVs may feature passport-style photos or snapshots taken on mobile phones, it's advisable to opt for a professional studio portrait or omit the photo entirely when applying. since you have already some basic German look on Stepstone articles and videos on Lebenslauf and Bewerbungsschreiben. General advise - focus less on your skills but more on your achivements in projects. Beef up your aplication with reference letters from your Ukrainian employers about the projects you have done. Read on stepstone what is Arbeitszeugnis. It very important in Germany. \n\nFurthermore, as an expat or immigrant, mobility is key. You're competing for English vacancies against a pool of international and huge amount of German applicants. Broadening your search radius beyond Bavaria could greatly enhance your opportunities. I have changed here already 4 cities to develop my career. With kids it might be difficult though. \n\nLastly, perseverance is paramount. I myself searched more than 6-month an internship here, even was considering working without pay at one point. However, my persistence paid off when I finally secured a promising opportunity that ultimately led to a permanent position. Don't lose heart—keep pushing forward, and success will follow.",

I've been working for a German company since arriving in Germany, and to secure my future here, I applied for a work visa/Blue Card through the **Ausländerbehörde** in my town.\n\nAfter three months of trying to get an appointment, I finally received a paper letter on 25.12.2023 with the required forms. I submitted the completed forms and all necessary documents by 04.01.2024.\n\nSince then, I haven't received any updates. Despite multiple emails, I've been met with silence. My German isn't great, so I asked friends to call the office on my behalf. After a few days of trying, they finally answered, confirming they had all my documents, and the application in the process, and told us not to contact them again.\n\nTwo months later, I asked my HR to follow up via email. Surprisingly, the response came quickly, but it was the same: my application was being processed, all needed documents were received fully, and there were delays due to heavy workloads. Again, they requested not to be contacted.\n\nFast forward to July (just two days before the 6-month anniversary of my application), I got an email asking for additional documents, including an employment declaration and my last three months' payslips. I sent everything right away and asked for clarification on some points, but, no surprise, received no response.\n\nI’m incredibly frustrated with the whole situation. It feels like Germany constantly talks about needing skilled workers, but the reality I'm facing seems different. I’m now seriously considering relocating my family to a country that’s more open to skilled immigrants.\n\nMy situation becomes even worse as my company is planning layoffs, so I’ll likely need to find a new job soon.\n\nIf anyone has experience dealing with the **Ausländerbehörde** in similar situations or knows if there are ways to officially complain about their lack of responsiveness, I would really appreciate your advice.\n\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the long post, I'm just really stressed out, especially with the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

In this school, my practical driving instructor is a Russian speaker too. He is a cool guy, and we became good friends over the period. As I am not a fluent German speaker and on the road I  want to make sure that I understand my instructor correctly, we usually communicate in Russian between each other.  \n\nRecently, before one of the practical classes, my instructor's colleagues complained that we speak Russian with each other in front of them, and they want us to speak German.  Just to be clear, they want me and my instructor to speak German in front of them.  I do not see those colleagues, nor I interact with with them more than \"Hallo\" and \"Tschuss\".  The only time I see them is whenever I come to the office to sign up and pay for the day's ride to my instructor,  and go to the car to start the lesson, so usually I am 2-3 minutes around them.  \n\nJust want to hear others opinion about this situation. Are they right to demand it? I understand that we are in Germany, and we should learn language, which I try to do, but forcing other people to speak their language even if they don't necessarily speak to you, I find it somehow not nice, but may be I am missing something here, and we should obey to their demands. \n\nI also wonder if this is because of the war in Ukraine that created a negative association with everything Russian.\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks guys for your comments, much appreciated.\n\nAfter noticing few controversial comments, please allow me to add couple of points:\n\nFirst of all, I didn’t have an intention to incite a xenophobic generalisation with this post, therefore please be respectful and do not generalise, especially about Germans. I have lots of German friends and colleagues and they are very nice and friendly. My colleagues are always respectful, speak English in our meetings without exceptions and support me whenever I ask them to speak German on 1x1s for me to practice it.\n\nWhile it is fair for people who are part of conversation, to find it rude if someone speaks language they don’t understand (I would feel the same),\n\nIn this case it is clearly different, let me highlight why \na) i am not their colleague, I am a customer of their firm\nb) I am not in office environment \nc) I don’t know other colleagues of my instructor and have no business with them at all, \nd). Before starting the school I clearly let the school know that that I’m interested in Russian speaking teacher as my German is weak. \ne). My instructor told me that his colleagues will ask their owner not to accept any other student that doesn’t speak German in the future.\n\nTo demand from me to speak their language while I am near them, is almost the same if for example I approached a reception of a hotel, let’s say in Spain and one of the guys turned out to be Russian speaker and he speaks Russian to me to help me better with my matter, and his colleagues would complain about that and ask me to speak English because they don’t understand what we are talking about although they are not part of the conversation at all.",

                "This is more about how you want to be perceived and what you want to communicate.\n\nFor example, I recently attended a conference with many german and english speakers, as well as dozens of other languages. I pretty much talked in english all the time, even when talking to other germans, Because it gives other people the opportunity to join in on the conversation, and it show open-ness and transparency. \n\nThere were a few situation where I switched to german, and did so deliberately. This communicates something differently, and will be perceived slightly differently. It makes the circle of people who can take part in the conversation smaller, and some people might interpret this as distant or maybe even slightly rude.\n\nSo the question is how do you want to be seen? Do you want to be seen as the eastern european guy who is trying to learn german nd immerses himself in the language and culture? Speak german when any german is around, and speak russian in the car when you are alone with your instructor.\n\nWant to be seen as someone who is uncomfortable with german, with everything this entails? Speak russian. Keep in mind that the current geopolitical situation adds an additional stigma to russian: this is not fair, but it is what it is. You need to be aware about this. Some people will think you have something to hide (and russian sound very hard and rough to german ears). Some peopel will think you are a slouch that doesn't even care about learning german. Most of these things will be blatantly wrong of course, and this isn't fair, but there is practically nothing positive in terms of how you will be *perceived* by others by speaking russian.\n\nThis isn't about if they are right or wrong to demand it. They have no legal right to demand anything, except when they own the business, then they could throw you out for not speaking german (hausrecht) -- but that is still unlikely.\n\nYour last sentence is btw. spot on. The current situation certainly gave the russian language a very negative connotation.",

                "I had a somewhat similar experience in the office a couple years ago. I speak 4 languages fluently and I don’t mind switching back and forth all the time. \n\nSo, one day we had managers visiting our office from Hungary and Hungarian is my native language too, though I grew up in another country. However, there was a meeting where one of the managers tried to explain something in German (her German was not the best), so I offered assistance and told her during the meeting to tell me in Hungarian and I’ll translate. She did that, I translated and we moved on. \nLater that day our office manager pulled me aside and explained to me that it is considered impolite to do that in front of others who don’t speak the language. It’s ok if we talk privately in the office in Hungarian but when others are around or involved we should stick to German/English. I think that’s fair, we stuck to that and everything was fine. \n\nMonths later, we had visitors from a Portuguese office. The guys spoke Portuguese all the time and then I felt kinda the same: dumb for not understanding what they were talking about… \n\nAt the end of the day, I guess it depends on the people around you and where you are, what you are doing. Some just shrug it off and don’t mind, while some may have something against Russians/French/Italian/whatever… and don’t like to hear that language, doesn’t matter if they are from/in Germany or any other country."

            "text": "My wife is a German resident permit holder from Ukraine for 12 years. She left Germany on 25th Dec 2023 to marry me in Australia on January 5, 2024, and stayed until May 27, 2024, after her conditional permanent residency (Visa 820 for partners) was granted in early May. This allowed her to leave Australia to return to Germany and extend her permit, which was set to expire on June 12, 2024. Although she had an appointment at the Immigration office in Germany on January 20, she chose to remain in Australia due to the costs associated with unnecessary travel and the ease of applying for her Visa 820 onshore.\n\nTo summarize, she had engaged a lawyer in Germany for her naturalization application, which she submitted in December 2023 before leaving for Australia. I lived in Germany for two years before moving to Australia in August 2023. She expected the lawyer to secure a new appointment for her residence permit pickup sometime in late May or early June, before her old permit expired. Unfortunately, the lawyer failed to file any applications or secure appointments, and she never received the conditional residence paper(fiktionsbescheinigung ) that would have prevented legal consequences for overstaying.\n\nUpon her arrival in Germany on 27th May 2024, she had to apply for a new residence permit asap and said that she had received it on July 5, 2024—23 days after her previous permit expired. Consequently, she is now facing legal issues. Our marriage is at risk due to misunderstandings and stress. She has tried to convince me to move to Germany, but I cannot undertake such a costly move, leading to her suggesting divorce. She is feeling guilty for what she has started just to prove that she is not guilty as she hid the overstaying issue right from begining from me and thought she could manage it.\n\nNow, that it is about 2 months we stopped talking on social media and even if I would call, she was overwhelmed with pressuure of court and our love , I believe she claims to justify her situation with emails she sent me, which she characterizes as abusive or stalking, despite the fact that we exchanged loving emails in early June.\n\nOn July 5, knowing I couldn't travel to Germany, she requested our marriage certificate, and I agreed to send it, as she mentioned considering registering our marriage there. This registration is important for our future plans, especially since my Blue Card has expired due to my prolonged absence and deregistration. However, after receiving the document, she claimed she did not intend to return and began sending harsh emails, stating she had requested a divorce since leaving for Germany on May 27, 2024. I believe she is using these emails to justify her absence and overstaying, while it was the lawyer's negligence that contributed to her situation.\n\nThe prosecution against her appears to have started in late June and could take 6 to 8 months as I checked other cases online ( she is not sharing anything as she is scared of my reaction or torn emotionally. ) I am trying to help her after I receive your support here. \n\n I doubt the court will take her emails seriously without my testimony, and since I'm no longer a resident of Germany, I may not be obligated to provide it. If I ignore any invitations or reject them, her justification weakens, leading to potential penalties for her. Conversely, if I cooperate with her claims, I risk my permanent residency in Australia being questioned and her sponsorship being revoked. If I try to be honest, she may face harsher penalties, and our marriage could be irreparably damaged.\n\n**The Solution:**  \nCould she potentially halt the prosecution in Germany if she voluntarily gives up her residency? Before leaving Australia, she was warned by her mother about possible complications but did not share this with me. She mentioned she would consider giving up her residency if things became too complicated, which I believe is now the case.",

I come from the eastern part of Ukraine and, unfortunately, have been subjected to a lot of bullying by others here.\n\nRecently, the situation reached a breaking point, and I decided to report it to the police. I told them everything about the bullying and also about the illegal work (Schwarzarbeit) that my neighbors are involved in. I also went to the Rathaus and reported the same issues there.\n\nHowever, nothing has come of it. The bullying has intensified, the police aren't taking any action, and the Rathaus told me they couldn't do anything.\n\nI'm feeling really stuck and desperate.

The Rathaus is not the right place to turn to, they don't get involved in stuff like that. \n\nYou could complain to your landlord about it, but if you're the only one, they probably won't do much either. For Schwarzarbeit, the Zoll is responsible, but again, you'll need proof. Also, don't hesitate contacting the police again if it gets worse.

                "Je copie ici un article du Courrier International.\n\n-\n\n__Guerre en Ukraine. Après la “trahison de Trump”, les Européens préparent un “sommet d’urgence” à Paris__\n\nVarsovie a affirmé samedi que la réunion, prévue lundi et organisée à l’initiative d’Emmanuel Macron, visait à discuter des défis posés par le plan de paix ukrainien de l’administration Trump. Pour la presse européenne, la rapidité de la réponse européenne témoigne de “l’ampleur de l’anxiété” sur le continent.\n\nDe plus en plus “inquiets” face à la possibilité que les États-Unis et la Russie “excluent le continent” européen des pourparlers autour d’un plan de paix en Ukraine, des dirigeants européens ont prévu de se retrouver lundi autour d’un “sommet d’urgence”, a rapporté samedi 15 février la BBC.\n\nD’après le ministre polonais des Affaires étrangères Radosław Sikorski, c’est le président français Emmanuel Macron qui a convié à Paris ses homologues pour discuter des défis posés par l’approche de l’administration Trump sur la question ukrainienne, souligne Politico. \"_Le président Trump a une méthode d’action que les Russes appellent razvedka boyem : la reconnaissance par le combat : vous poussez et vous voyez ce qui se passe, puis vous changez de position. … Et nous devons réagir_\", a déclaré le ministre polonais.\n\nOutre le Premier ministre polonais Donald Tusk, le Premier ministre britannique Keir Starmer a lui aussi été convié, selon le Daily Telegraph. Tout comme le chancelier allemand Olaf Scholz et son homologue italienne, Giorgia Meloni, précise Bloomberg. L’Elysée n’a pas confirmé la tenue d’une rencontre lundi, évoquant des «discussions en cours».\n\nLes Européens s’efforcent de faire front commun depuis l’entretien téléphonique de mercredi entre Donald Trump et Vladimir Poutine, à l’issue duquel le président américain a dit être convenu avec son homologue russe d’entamer des négociations sur la paix en Ukraine. Les alliés de l’Ukraine redoutent notamment que la nouvelle administration américaine ne “cède tout” à la Russie et d’être tenus à l’écart de toute prise de décision.\n\n__“Trop de parties impliquées”, selon Kellogg__\n\nSelon la BBC, l’envoyé spécial américain Keith Kellogg a lui-même affirmé samedi \"_que les négociations précédentes avaient échoué parce que trop de parties étaient impliquées_\", et a laissé entendre que les Européens ne seraient pas directement invités à prendre part aux pourparlers même s’ils auraient leur “mot à dire”.\n\nSamedi, dans un discours à la Conférence de Munich sur la sécurité, devant un parterre de responsables politiques internationaux, le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a, lui, “exhorté” les Européens à se renforcer pour éviter un accord forgé par les Américains “dans le dos” de l’Ukraine et de l’Europe.\n\nIl les a notamment encouragés à “créer les forces armées de l’Europe”. \"_Le temps où l’Amérique soutenait l’Europe simplement parce qu’elle l’avait toujours fait est révolu_\", a-t-il mis en garde.\n\n__“Trahison” de Trump__\n\n\"_La trahison de l’Ukraine par Donald Trump a enhardi Vladimir Poutine et coupé l’herbe sous le pied des alliés de l’OTAN_\", remarque le Guardian. \"_La réunion, qui se tiendra probablement lundi, devrait discuter des efforts américains visant à exclure les dirigeants européens des pourparlers de paix, de la position que l’Europe devrait adopter sur la future adhésion de l’Ukraine à l’OTAN et de la manière dont l’Ukraine peut se voir offrir des garanties de sécurité, soit par l’intermédiaire de l’OTAN, soit par une force européenne_\".\n\nPour le quotidien britannique, \"_la rapidité avec laquelle Macron a tenté d’unifier les dirigeants européens autour d’une réponse commune montre l’ampleur de l’anxiété en Europe face aux efforts américains visant à la fois à contrôler le processus et à exclure les gouvernements européens de toute négociation_\".\n\nPar __Noémie Taylor-Rosner__\n\n\n(__Abonnez vous au Courrier International.__)",

Faire la démonstration que oui, la démocratie libérale est plus performante qu'une autocratie corrompue, et que les légères tensions internes que peuvent connaître nos sociétés multiethniques ne sont pas un frein à se projeter à l'extérieur.  \nBref, envoyer des troupes, c'est pour combattre pas pour servir de cible, surtout quand le fer est déjà bien chaud, et que toute la chaine logistique et d'approvisionnement russe semble pâtir (ou alors il faut pendre tous nos décideurs et médias qui mentent ou se trompent depuis 3 ans : mais personnellement je ne doute pas de la corruption complète du système russe).\n\nA l'inverse, si on décide d'envoyer des troupes pour ne rien faire jusqu'au jour où elles se feront tirer dessus par les russes; alors oui, autant rester dans les frontières de l'OTAN et voir si les américains bluff ou pas.  \nIl faut quand même rappeler que si les US abandonnent les pays Baltes, alors ils perdront immédiatement toute crédibilité auprès des coréens, des japonais, des taïwanais, des philippines, bref de tous les membres de leur coalition asiatique qui vont s'empresser d'aller voir ce qui se dit finalement en Chine.   \nVéritablement abandonner l'Europe au profit d'un pivot asiatique ne peut pas fonctionner.  \nSurtout qu'on peut dire ce qu'on veut, mais je pense que l'Occident est encore vu comme une collection de pays \"blancs\" à l'international, donc je doute que des asiatiques voyant les américains abandonner des européens, les imaginent plus prêt à venir à leur aide.",

Poutine est devenu l’otage de ses propres mensonges, et cela pourrait avoir des conséquences graves pour son régime. Pendant deux ans, il y a eu des incursions à la frontière, mais aucune vraie défense n’a été mise en place.\n\nCe matin, j'ai vu que des images de MAXAR [1] montraient des tranchées en train d'être creusées juste à l'ouest de Lgov (ex: [cette image](https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/15/05/Russia_Ukraine_War_66418.jpg?quality=75&width=1368&auto=webp), aux coordonnées [51.633, 35.229](https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B037'58.8%22N+35%C2%B013'44.4%22E/@51.6330033,35.2270706,692m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d51.633!4d35.229?entry=ttu)). C'est à dire à ~45 km de la frontière avec l'Ukraine. Forcément, ils ne vont pas construire leurs fortifications sous le feu, donc il n'est pas étonnant que cette distance soit bien supérieure à celle du terrain contrôlé par l'armée ukrainienne (10 ou 20 km de profondeur suivant les zones). En revanche, cela semble montrer qu'ils s'attendent à ce que la présence ukrainienne dure (j'étais le premier à penser que les ukrainiens se retireraient en quelques jours). Quelle défaite pour Poutine de non seulement voir l'armée ukrainienne traverser les frontières, mais d'également devoir abandonner 50 km de profondeur. \n\n[1 - The Independant - Satellite photos show how Ukraine’s gamble on an incursion deep into Russia changed the battlefield (2024-08-15)](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kursk-map-moscow-russia-ukraine-b2596683.html)"

Bien sûr, il y a de nombreux acteurs qui profitent de ça dont l'état islamique et la Russie mais ça reste une guerre interne entre le pouvoir en place et des groupes opposants. Du coup, dure de vraiment prendre partis ici pour les Syriens puisqu'eux mêmes sont divisés. Ça n'empêche pas la misère et le fait qu'il y ait des réfugiés, c'est juste que les gentils et méchants ne sont pas clairement défini.\n\nTandis qu'en Ukraine, on a clairement les pauvres Ukrainiens qui n'ont rien demandés et qui se font attaqués par la méchante Russie. La, il n'y a pas de doute...\n\nOn ajoute à ça aussi le fait que les hommes Ukrainiens sont forcés de se battre pour leur pays donc les réfugiés Ukrainiens sont majoritairement des femmes et enfants.

                "Pour mieux comprendre l'histoire des lettres de crédit, je vais faire une explication super simplifiée de comment fonctionne le commerce de matières premières.\n\nOn a un producteur de pétrole qui cherche à vendre son pétrole brut. Avant que le pétrole soit utilisé par le consommateur final il doit être raffiné. Donc le producteur doit trouver un moyer de l'acheminer à une raffinerie. Le problème du producteur c'est que la plupart du temps il n'a pas accès à la logistique pour pouvoir le faire car il n'a ni l'argent, ni le temps et ni l'expertise nécessaire. \n\nC'est là que rentrent en jeu les courtiers en matières premières (commodity traders). Ils ont soit leur propre réseau logistique, soit ils ont le capital nécessaire pour louer les bateaux, les camions et autres moyens de transport nécessaires. Ils ont généralement aussi des terminaux pétroliers pour stocker le pétrole si la demande n'est pas suffisante au moment où le producteur veut vendre (car la demande est saisonnière et la production ne peut pas toujours s'adapter rapidement).\n\nOr le fait est que le producteur veut être sûr qu'on va le payer, pourquoi est-ce qu'il aurait confiance envers le courtier avec une cargaison qui vaut des millions ? À moins que le courtier ne se pointe avec une valise pleine de dollars, il n'a pas envie de vendre son pétrole. Le problème du courtier c'est qu'il ne se fait qu'une petite marge sur la transaction, il n'a pas l'argent pour payer chaque producteur avec qui il travaille, il ne peut que les payer une fois que les raffineries l'auront payé quand il aura acheminé le pétrole à destination. \n\nC'est là que rentrent en jeu les lettres de crédit. La banque du courtier émet un titre que le courtier peut donner au producteur, qui veut essentiellement dire \"même si mon client fait faillite, je te promets de te payer dans 30-60 jours si tu lui donne ton pétrole en échange de ce titre\". C'est plus puissant qu'un chèque car même si le courtier n'a pas suffisamment d'argent sur son compte à l'échéance, le producteur sera payé par la banque.\n\nLe producteur peut alors transmettre la lettre de crédit à sa propre banque qui lui versera une avance et qui prendra en charge le règlement de la dette de la banque du courtier.\n\nAutrement dit, ça retire quasiment l'intégralité du risque du producteur dans la transaction, pour lui la lettre de crédit c'est un super chèque qui sera encaissé quoi qu'il arrive.\n\nEn interdisant aux banques russes qui sont les banques de producteurs de gaz ou de pétrole russe d'utiliser des dollars et d'utiliser SWIFT, on leur interdit d'utiliser des des lettres de crédit libellées en dollars (euros, livres et yen aussi) et de négocier facilement avec les banques des courtiers en matières premières. \n\nDonc maintenant pour acheter du pétrole russe, faut soit aller directement en Russie avec des valises de cash, ce qui n'est pas pratique du tout et comme je l'ai dit, les courtiers n'ont généralement pas ce cash à disposition, ou bien s'arranger avec des banques chinoises pour qu'elles fassent des lettres de crédit en yuan, ce qui rajoute un intermédiaire, donc baisse les marges qui sont déjà faibles et donc n'est pas idéal non plus, sachant que les producteurs russes n'ont peut-être même pas envie d'accepter un paiement en yuan.\n\nLe résultat c'est que les producteurs russes sont obligés de vendre leur pétrole et gaz au rabais et/ou prendre beaucoup plus de risque (ce qu'on appelle en finance le risque de contrepartie).",
                "[Message de victoire accidentellement publié par l'agence de presse publique RIA Novosty](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html)\n\nLa [traduction en anglais, faite par un redditeur](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2tx0g/russian_propaganda_outlet_accidentally_publishes/hyoagnf/) d'AirUkraine, est extrêmement flippante : \n\n> A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.\n\n> Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia. \n\n> Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.\n\n> Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said\n\n> Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.\n\n> The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that \"only Ukraine is real Russia,\" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when \"we lost Ukraine.\" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.\n\n> Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.\n\n> And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.\n\n> Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.\n\n> More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.\n\n> Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.\n\n> Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.\n\n> But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the \"Russian threat\" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.\n\n> Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.\n\n> China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",

Nous ferons tout ce qu’il faut pour que la Russie ne puisse pas gagner cette guerre », a expliqué Emmanuel Macron, lundi soir.\n\n\nEn gros il dit : \"aujourd'hui on ne veut pas, mais qui sait de quoi demain sera fait ?\" \n\n\nTechnically the truth du coup.",
                "La conférence: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdxZD753pPw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdxZD753pPw) (le son est mauvais)\n\nIl rajoute que des \"troupes\" pourraient être envoyées pour \"sécuriser des dispositifs\", ce qui n'a rien de très tabou (pour moi) ou de très surprenant, ça se fait d'ailleurs sûrement déjà à un certain niveau, et je suis même pas sûr de voir l'intérêt de communiquer sur le sujet avec autant de prudence quand encore une fois, chez les russes, ils disent déjà qu'ils se battent contre les troupes de l'OTAN sur le terrain. Si demain j'apprenais que des militaires de pays de l'OTAN sont en Ukraine pour bien voir que tout ce qu'on a envoyé est arrivé et fonctionne, je tomberai pas de ma chaise.\n\nJe trouve intéressant qu'il ait mentionné la protection à la frontière biélorusse, qui monopolise sûrement des troupes ukrainiennes, par contre il a rajouté \"avec des forces non-militaires\" donc ça reste assez mou dans le langage, enfin ça balance l'a non-négation de l'envoi de troupes.",
                "Je crois moyennement à l'envoi de troupes occidentales en Ukraine (il aurait fallu le faire dès le début, maintenant c'est un peu tard). En revanche, je retiens un autre passage : \n\n> Il a été décidé de « créer une coalition pour les frappes dans la profondeur et donc les missiles et bombes de moyenne et longue portée », a-t-il dit lors de la conférence de presse qui a maintenant pris fin.\n\nCe serait cool si on pouvait ENFIN autoriser l'Ukraine à frapper les infrastructures militaires et l'outil industriel qui lui permet de maintenir son effort de guerre (et convaincre l'Allemagne d'arrêter de faire chier avec ses Taurus). Pour l'instant, c'est comme vouloir faire un match de boxe sans avoir le droit de frapper son adversaire et ne pouvoir qu'espérer qu'il s'essouffle. Sauf qu'en attendant, il y a des gens qui meurent.",

                "\n>**Ukraine: les Russes reculent, la «poutinosphère» française patine**\n\n\n>Entre déni et complotisme, les influenceurs pro-Kremlin en France peinent à évoquer les revers de l’armée russe face à la contre-offensive ukrainienne de ces derniers jours.\n\n\n>On allait voir ce qu’on allait voir. Kyiv devait tomber en trois jours. Puis l’armée des «ukronazis» allait s’effondrer face à l’élan russe. Puis Vladimir Poutine, grand joueur d’échecs, avait changé de stratégie et allait renverser la table. Et puis, et puis… Et puis la contre-offensive ukrainienne est arrivée et a rebattu les cartes sur le terrain, au point qu’«on ne peut plus exclure une reprise totale du territoire», selon l’ancien colonel de l’armée de Terre et historien Michel Goya dans Libé. De quoi provoquer un grand bug dans le logiciel des influenceurs pro-Poutine français – cette sphère éclectique, d’influenceurs qui reprennent et diffusent les mots du Kremlin, parfois jusqu’à la caricature.\n\n\n\n>«La victoire sera nôtre de toute façon», lançait sur Twitter samedi le Français Xavier Moreau (37 000 abonnés), proche d’Alain Soral et administrateur d’un blog «d’analyses géopolitiques et économiques sur toutes les zones, pays et continents» très décrié pour sa désinformation. Un homme qui compte aussi près de 180 000 abonnés à sa chaîne YouTube. Quelques heures plus tôt pourtant, toujours sur Twitter, Moreau affichait une sidération teintée de pessimisme : «Fulgurante offensive de Kiev dans la région de Kharkiv. Retrait Russe. Echec militaire russe retentissant.» Un tweet rapidement effacé… pour laisser place à un discours revigoré.\n\n\n>**Poussés dans leurs retranchements**\n\n\n>Ces tergiversations illustrent parfaitement la stupeur, voire la panique qui a frappé les pro russes français à l’annonce des premiers succès de la contre-offensive ukrainienne dans l’est du pays. Une attaque éclair qui a littéralement enfoncé les forces russes, rejetées des dizaines de kilomètres en arrière de la ligne de front. Les influenceurs pro Poutine ont eux aussi été poussés dans leurs retranchements. Il y a ceux qui ont sorti les sacs de sable et décidé de tenir la ligne coûte que coûte, et les autres, qui ont décidé d’opérer une retraite discrète.\n\n\n>A l’image de l’économiste Jacques Sapir, dont le nom d’utilisateur sur Twitter, où il compte plus de 42 000 abonnés, est «russeurope». C’est lui qui, il y a cinq mois, annonçait en grande pompe sur la webtélé insoumise le Média que «l’armée ukrainienne allait s’effondrer» incessamment. Après un long silence, il ne se hasarde plus, désormais, à des analyses militaro-stratégiques. Il insiste ces derniers jours surtout sur le dynamisme de l’économie russe, pourtant lourdement handicapée par les sanctions internationales… Et se contente désormais de relayer ceux qui expliquent que «la phase 2 dans le Donbass à base d’artillerie et d’assauts urbains est terminée. Le changement de format stratégique des opérations russes est quasi acté». Tout va très bien, madame la tsarine.\n\n\n>**Dédouaner les Russes**\n\n\n>Il y a aussi, donc, le dernier carré qui occulte la portée des avancées ukrainiennes. Souvent anonymes, comme cet utilisateur twitter qui, lundi, entre deux saillies complotistes, répétait que la Russie «deuxième puissance militaire mondiale» a forcément tout calculé : «Ils peuvent rayer de la carte l’Ukraine en une matinée s’ils veulent. Mais jusqu’à maintenant ils essayent d’épargner au max les civils.» Un discours repris par quelques notabilités numériques, comme l’avocat Régis de Castelnau (32 000 abonnés sur Twitter) qui, après avoir assuré fin août qu’il n’y aurait jamais de contre-offensive, dénonce désormais ceux qui «confond[ent] contre-attaque et contre-offensive», reprenant une information non vérifiée assurant que celle-ci est «menée par des étrangers dirigés par l’Otan».\n\n\n\n\n\n>Ce narratif complotiste qui voudrait que des «mercenaires d’Academi» (la grande société militaire privée américaine, ex-Blackwater) seraient à la pointe de l’offensive ukrainienne sur Kharkiv. L’une des premières sources francophone a l’avoir évoqué n’est autre que Christelle Néant, fondatrice du site pro séparatistes Donbass Insider (près de 200 000 visites, notamment d’internautes français, en août). Une façon de dédouaner l’armée russe pour ce revers, d’en enlever le crédit à l’armée de Volodymyr Zelensky, et de véhiculer le scénario d’une guerre mondiale menée par l’Otan.\n\n\n>**«Poutine a un plan»**\n\n\n>Le dernier carré des pro-Poutine compte également dans ses rangs les fanatiques de la mouvance QAnon française. Ces pro Trump convaincus que l’Etat américain est infiltré, tenu même, par une cinquième colonne «pédo-sataniste» sont historiquement des grands fans de Poutine. Un homme, un vrai, qui protège son pays des «délires» progressistes et LGBT+. Habitués aux contorsions, ils font assaut de souplesse pour tenir leur ligne d’une Russie invincible. Sur le site phare de la mouvance, Qactus.fr (autour de 500 000 visites par mois en moyenne), presque aucun des derniers billets sur la guerre en Ukraine n’évoque les récents déboires russes. La situation occupe pourtant les esprits, à en croire les nombreux échanges dédiés dans leurs fils de discussion sur l’application Telegram. Là aussi, toutefois, l’optimisme règne : «Poutine n’aurait pas participé aux différents événements organisés à Moscou pour la Journée de la ville [ce week-end, ndlr] si la situation sur les fronts du NWO [«New World Order», les organisateurs du supposé complot mondial, ndlr] était critique», résume un utilisateur. Qui conclut : «L’initiative dans le cadre du NWO est passée à l’Ukraine. Poutine démontre qu’il a un plan.»\n\n\n>Bonus : chez les QAnons, en fait, on se réjouirait presque. La poursuite de la guerre et la crise énergétique mondiale qui en résulte seraient en passe de faire échouer le «great reset», ce fantasme d’un plan d’asservissement des peuples via un effondrement économique fomenté par le Forum économique mondial de Klaus Schwab.",

Je suppose qu'ils préparent un communiqué. C'est très clairement une menace nucléaire de la part de Poutine, il y a difficilement plus gros marqueur que ça.

                "Bon, je risque de m'en prendre plein la tête, mais on va essayer d'avoir un discours concret sur la question de l'Ukraine. \n\nLa problématique aujourd'hui, c'est que l'Occident (et dans une certaine mesure Zelinsky) font un pari : Ils espèrent que la Russie finisse par s'effondrer du fait d'un côté de la résistance ukrainienne et de l'autre des sanctions. Ca fait un peu plus de 2 ans que c'est la stratégie, et les Occidentaux pour l'instant cherchent à soutenir la résistance ukrainienne sans non plus trop s'engager. Et ce n'est pas la fourniture de F16 ou de Mirage 2000 qui vont permettre une victoire militaire de l'Ukraine, faut pas se faire d'illusions. \n\nDu coup, on se retrouve dans une situation où tout est gelé depuis à peu près un an. Pendant ce temps là, les Ukrainiens continuent de se prendre des missiles et des bombes sur la gueule, et leur pays d'être ravagé, tandis que la Russie ne montre toujours pas de signes de rupture, et même, au contraire, Poutine apparaît plus renforcé que jamais. \n\nDe là, trois scénarios possibles : \n\n1. Poutine a fait tapis avec son invasion de l'Ukraine et menace constamment les Occidentaux d'un conflit nucléaire. On décide de tenir le bluff et on fixe un ultimatum à Poutine : Si dans 3 mois les troupes russes ont pas quitté l'Ukraine, l'OTAN rentre dans le pays et les mets dehors avec toute la puissance conventionnelle à notre disposition. On regarde si, face à cette pression, Poutine se couche ou tente le tout pour le tout. C'est évidemment une position extrêmement risquée, vu qu'elle a des chances de mener à une guerre nucléaire. \n\n2. On considère que l'Ukraine ne pourra pas, au vu des moyens humains à sa disposition, obtenir des victoires militaires suffisantes pour chasser les Russes hors du pays. On pousse donc l'Ukraine a faire des concessions difficiles (Crimée, Donbass) pour obtenir la paix, en échange d'une intégration dans l'OTAN et dans l'UE, et des investissements massifs dans la reconstruction et la modernisation du pays, pour permettre au peuple Ukrainien d'atteindre de biens meilleurs niveaux de vie et de confort et leur offrir un meilleur avenir. Ca implique pour l'Ukraine, et pour Zelinsky, une perte de prestige immense, mais ça épargne la vie des civils. \n\n3. On continue l'approche actuelle, qui est de fournir à l'Ukraine suffisamment de matériel pour qu'elle ne s'effondre pas mais pas assez pour qu'elle puisse faire quelque chose de concret. On maintient encore pendant des années un conflit meurtrier pour les civils, en espérant que la Russie s'épuise avant nous, ce qui semble compliqué car elle bénéficie probablement du soutien chinois en sous main. Ce n'est pas une stratégie de sortie, juste un maintien du statu quo, avec néanmoins un risque dans le sens inverse d'un effondrement de l'Ukraine sur le long terme.\n\nIl est facile de soutenir la résistance ukrainienne à plusieurs centaines de kilomètres du front. Ce ne sont pas nos familles, nos amis, nos proches, qui meurent dans les bombardements russes. Ce ne sont pas nos vies qui sont en permanence sous la menace des raids aériens, des frappes d'artilleries et des missiles. Il est bien beau de soutenir l'admirable courage du peuple ukrainien sans en avoir à en payer le prix. \n\nBref, que chacun fasse son choix en conscience. Mais juste \"Soutenir la résistance ukrainienne\" sans être prêt à s'engager pleinement dans le conflit, ce n'est pas à mes yeux une position de courage. C'est une position attentiste qui se paie avec le sang des Ukrainiens.",

            "text": " Salut tout le monde,\n\nPetite présentation rapide : je m'appelle Fabrice Deprez, je suis actuellement journaliste au service Monde de La Croix, chargé (entre autres) des pays de l'espace post-soviétique. J'étais ces trois dernières semaines en Ukraine, arrivé quelques jours avant le début de la guerre et reparti au début de cette semaine. Je n'ai pas découvert l'Ukraine avec cette guerre puisque j'ai aussi été pendant trois ans (et jusqu'à l'année dernière) correspondant basé à Kiev. Donc au-delà de l'expérience de la guerre en elle-même, n'hésitez pas à poser des questions sur l'Ukraine ou la Russie en général, deux pays que je connais (relativement) bien. Et évidemment si vous avez des questions sur la manière dont les journalistes travaillent dans ce genre de situation ou... n'importe quel autre sujet qui tourne autour de cette guerre, allez-y.\n\nJe publie ce post un peu en avance mais je m'attaquerai aux questions sans doute plutôt vers 13h, pas de panique si je ne réponds pas immédiatement !",

Une guerre rapide contre l'armée ukrainienne, et la population civile qui accepte d'être ramenée dans le giron de la Russie sans résister ? Avaient-ils des plans pour un futur oblast ukrainien (ou une république fédérale, que sais-je) ?",

Du coup, je présume que tu as un peu étudié les tactiques soviétiques en Afghanistan 1979-1992.\n\nEst-ce qu'il y a des parallèles entre à faire entre le comportement de l'armée soviétique en Afghanistan et de l'armée russe en Ukraine (et puis tiens, de l'armée russe en Tchétchénie tant qu'on y est) ? Est-ce que les Russes ont l'air d'avoir tiré des leçons de ces deux guerres ?",

Est ce vrai ? \n\nLes gelées semblent tardives. Est ce que les ukrainiens comptent sur la boue pour ralentir encore un peu plus l'avancée des russes ? \n\nEst ce que les ukrainiens pensent vraiment arriver à repousser les russes ?\n\nÉdith : la Croix, c'est extra."

Les troupes russes sont connues pour éviter de se blesser au visage afin qu’elles puissent être identifiées et que leur famille reçoive la prime. Si le but était de cacher les morts nord-coréennes, ce serait sans doute plus efficace de les faire passer pour des habitants de l’Extrême-Orient russe que d’avoir subitement un tas de corps au visage calciné dont on sait que ce sont probablement les Nord-Coréens en question.

Et même des fois on les envoie se noyer, parce que ... parce que leur bonnet est bleu je suppose.\n\n\\- des tanks qui vont au combat avec du blindage réactif d'exercice\n\n\\- des Su-34 qui utilisent des GPS civils parce que leur Glonass ne passe pas\n\n\\- des camions aux pneus chinois pourris qui déjantent ou éclatent\n\n\\- des troupes qui communiquent via radio à 20 balles chez Lidl\n\n\\- une logistique tellement défaillante que les troupes pillent les magasins et abandonnent en pleine nature leurs tanks, tanks récupérés par l'opposition ukrainienne en territoire occupé qui parade avec en pleine journée\n\n\\- des policiers anti-émeute envoyés AVANT l'armée qui donc logiquement crèvent lorsqu'ils tombent sur l'armée ukrainienne à Kyiv\n\n\\- une incapacité manifeste à acquérir la supériorité aérienne alors qu'ils sont à putain de 10 contre 1\n\n\\- une colonne de la mort qui stagne depuis maintenant une semaine près de Kiev alors qu'elle rassemble 2 (2 !) armées blindées\n\n\\- et là je viens d'apprendre que les agents locaux du FSB achètent des cartes SIM au Franprix du coin pour annoncer la mort d'un général de la famille du second grand chef des armées à leur hiérarchie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLe seul succès opérationnel qu'ils ont eu est dans le sud, et je parie que la semaine prochaine les colonnes vont aussi s'essouffler et échouer au pied d'Odessa. Qu'ils vont donc comme ailleurs tenter d'aplatir parce qu'ils n'ont plus que la force brute comme solution. En attendant que, je ne sais pas, un de leurs généraux s'électrocute en faisant pipi sur un câble qui aura été coupé par un sabotage antérieur du FSB. En attendant, c'est massacre généralisé un peu partout, comportement odieux sur les couloirs humanitaires, et une catastrophe humanitaire sans précédent en Europe depuis la guerre de Yougoslavie. Et en Russie c'est atroce aussi, entre les mères qui apprennent que leurs fils ont crevé dans la boue ukrainienne alors qu'elles croyaient qu'ils finissaient tranquille leur service militaire et une économie qui va faire revivre les années joyeuses 90 où les gosses affamés se droguaient à l'isolant frelaté dans les rues pour oublier leur misère.\n\nEt tout ça parce que, in fine,  ces moooossieurs de la haute russe se sont montrés d'une légèreté et d'une incompétence totale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPUTAIN . Quand Assad massacrait sa population, c'était son régime qu'il tentait de sauver. Ca n'excuse rien du tout, mais il y avait un enjeu. Poutine n'était PAS dans cette situation, du tout : le pays était stable, les sous rentraient, l'industrie se modernisait, le niveau de vie progressait - avec de très fortes inégalités, mais il progressait. Internationalement, il y avait une palanquée d'options pour mettre la pression sur l'Ukraine et négocier sa neutralité, voire la reconnaissance de gains territoriaux : NordStream 2, miroiter des avantages de partenariat économique, putain même cyniquement financer une opposition à un Zelensky pas forcément plébiscité pour patiemment et tranquillement arriver à ses fins. Même l'option aggressive d'occuper le Donbass aurait fait grincer des dents mais serait passée. Mais non ! Poutine a décidé de faire son gros caca pour se faire bien plaisir, et il s'étonne de se retrouver dans la merde. Et donc il décide de pourrir la vie de dizaines, non de CENTAINES de millions de personnes parce que son cerveau fini à la pisse ne lui permet pas de trouver une solution correcte.\n\nOn a des enfants qui souffrent, des enfants qui meurent, pas par la suite d'événements cataclysmiques, mais UNIQUEMENT par incompétence crasse. Et ça va durer comme ça des mois.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJ'en pleure de rage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR on a droit à la première crise humanitaire de l'histoire causée par une organisation qui fait apparaitre la 7me compagnie comme une unité d'élite. Même les amerloques, lorsqu'ils ont renversé Saddam avec leur fausse excuse à la pisse d'arme de destruction massive, ont été capables  de prendre l'Irak sans trop de casse - l'occupation de l'Irak c'est une autre paire de manches évidemment, mais là les Russes n'en sont même pas à ce stade. C'est juste ... nul.",
                "[Guerre en Ukraine : « le rouleau compresseur » russe risque de finir par passer, selon le chef d’état-major des armées](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/03/06/guerre-en-ukraine-le-rouleau-compresseur-russe-risque-de-finir-par-passer-selon-le-chef-d-etat-major-des-armees_6116336_3210.html)\n\n**Pour le chef d’état-major de l’armée, Thierry Burkhard, « les Russes veulent tronçonner l’armée » ukrainienne.**\n\n\nC’est la deuxième fois qu’il s’exprime depuis le début de la guerre ouverte entre la Russie et l’Ukraine, le 24 février. Le chef d’état-major des armées (CEMA), le général Thierry Burkhard, a reçu Le Monde, vendredi 4 mars, dans son bureau de Balard, le Pentagone français, situé dans le 15e arrondissement de Paris. Une heure entre deux réunions d’un emploi du temps désormais rythmé d’un côté par le pilotage délicat du retrait du Mali, et de l’autre par les combats ukrainiens et les nouveaux engagements de la France dans ce conflit d’une violence inédite aux frontières de l’OTAN.\n\nLe conflit ukrainien « faisait partie des options dès l’été 2021, lorsque j’ai pris mes fonctions », raconte le général Burkhard. « Des renseignements disaient que les Russes attendraient des conditions météorologiques favorables, c’est-à-dire qu’il fasse froid », avant d’attaquer l’Ukraine. « Le déclenchement de l’attaque n’a donc pas été une surprise », dit-il. « Le soir précédent, des informations précises ont été partagées par les alliés », selon lui. Dès que les premiers bombardements ont eu lieu dans la nuit du 23 au 24 février, « nous avons activé les mesures prévues, résume-t-il. Chaque poste qui devait être renforcé au sein des armées a été renforcé ».\n\n\nIl y a eu des divergences d’analyses en matière de renseignement entre les Français et les pays anglo-saxons, reconnaît le général Burkhard. « Les Américains disaient que les Russes allaient attaquer, ils avaient raison. Nos services pensaient plutôt que la conquête de l’Ukraine aurait un coût monstrueux et que les Russes avaient d’autres options » pour faire chuter le régime de Volodymyr Zelensky, détaille-t-il. Une forme de prudence vis-à-vis du renseignement américain, héritée notamment de la guerre en Irak de 2003.\n\n**Un nouveau centre de conduite des opérations**\n\nCes débats passés, dès le début des combats, le 24 février, la France a commencé à déployer des moyens pour s’intégrer dans les plans de l’OTAN. Dès midi, une première patrouille de Rafale a été envoyée dans le ciel polonais, frontalier de l’Ukraine. Depuis, la France continue d’y assurer deux patrouilles de six à huit heures par jour. Les Rafale décollent de la base de Mont-de-Marsan (Landes), le ravitailleur, de celle d’Istres (Bouches-du-Rhône), ils volent jusqu’en Pologne puis rentrent en France à l’issue de leur mission quotidienne. Des Awacs, ces avions de renseignement équipés de radars, partent, eux, régulièrement de la base d’Avord, dans le Cher.\n\n\nToutes ces opérations sont pilotées depuis un bâtiment flambant neuf, situé sur la base de Lyon-Mont Verdun (Rhône). Depuis l’été 2021, la France dispose d’un nouveau centre air de planification et de conduite des opérations (Capco) aux normes OTAN. Une vaste salle aux murs couverts d’immenses écrans lui permettant de centraliser aussi bien les images de drones et les frappes contre les groupes armés terroristes au Sahel que les patrouilles aux limites de la frontière ukrainienne et les missions de transport aérien pour les soldats français en train d’être déployés en Roumanie. Soit une petite dizaine de vols par jour actuellement – le Capco peut en gérer jusqu’à 150 par jour.\n\nSur une carte de l’Ukraine déployée dans son bureau, le général Burkhard développe son analyse de la situation. Même s’ils mettent plus de temps que prévu, « les Russes ont pour objectif de tronçonner l’armée ukrainienne », estime-t-il. Cette dernière dispose d’environ 40 000 hommes face au Donbass et de 50 000 autres pour tenir le reste du pays. « Mais pour isoler les premiers des deuxièmes, les Russes vont devoir engager le deuxième échelon de leurs forces », ce qui n’était sans doute pas prévu, considère le général Burkhard. En plus des carences logistiques, l’armée russe « semble avoir un sujet de combativité dans certaines unités », qui n’ont pas forcément été préparées à la haute intensité, pense-t-il. Mais « le risque, c’est que le rouleau compresseur » russe finisse par passer : une question de semaines ou de mois, liée à l’organisation de la résistance ukrainienne, évalue-t-il.\n\n**Des mercenaires de Groupe Wagner en Ukraine**\n\nD’après le général Burkhard, il n’y a pas de certitudes à ce stade sur la présence de Biélorusses sur le théâtre ukrainien. Il y en a plus en revanche du côté des mercenaires de la société privée russe Groupe Wagner, même s’il ne s’aventure pas à confirmer un chiffre. L’engagement des Wagner en Ukraine peut d’ailleurs avoir des conséquences sur les capacités de déploiement des mêmes mercenaires au Mali, qui serait désormais autour de 1 000. La Russie a par ailleurs installé une véritable « barrière antiaérienne », des Pays baltes à la Méditerranée, analyse le général Burkhard, notamment en déployant des systèmes de défense S-400 très sophistiqués.\n\nEn face, depuis le 24 février, l’OTAN renforce ses capacités. Selon nos évaluations, environ 22 000 hommes sont déployés au sol, quelque 20 navires et 125 avions pour des patrouilles aériennes ou de la police du ciel. Un vaste dispositif de la mer du Nord à la Méditerranée, au sein duquel les armées françaises, en plus de leur nouvelle mission en Pologne, vont maintenir 4 Mirage 2000 et 200 hommes en Estonie. A cet effort s’ajoutent depuis le 28 février les 500 hommes envoyés en renfort en Roumanie et, depuis ce samedi 5 mars, les moyens du porte-avions Charles-de-Gaulle à partir de la mer Ionienne. Déroutés de leur mission initiale, ces avions « pourront effectuer de la réassurance avec des patrouilles aériennes », détaille le général.\n\nSur la posture de dissuasion nucléaire, qui relève du domaine réservé du président de la République, le chef d’état-major des armées ne fait aucun commentaire. Le 1er mars, le journal Le Télégramme a révélé que la France avait, pour la première fois depuis 1981 et la crise des euromissiles, mis un deuxième sous-marin nucléaire lanceur d’engins (SNLE) en patrouille à la mer. Jusqu’à présent, un seul des quatre SNLE basés à L’Ile-Longue (Finistère) dont dispose la France assurait cette permanence. Un signal, alors que Moscou ne cesse d’agiter la menace nucléaire dans le conflit ukrainien et que ces sous-marins peuvent emporter 16 missiles (M51) chacun équipés de six têtes nucléaires.\n\n**Echange avec le chef d’état-major russe**\n\nLe niveau de vigilance a aussi été renforcé dans les domaines cyber et spatial, confirme le CEMA. Mais « aucun débordement intentionnel » du conflit ukrainien n’a été observé dans ces domaines-là pour l’instant, assure le général Burkhard. A ce titre, il observe avec attention « la guerre du narratif » qui a actuellement lieu en Ukraine. « Les Ukrainiens se sont très bien préparés en matière de résilience cyber et de lutte informationnelle. Les Russes vont découvrir ce que c’est que de remonter le narratif adverse face à ce tsunami », observe-t-il, tout en restant à la fois prudent et circonspect sur les objectifs de Vladimir Poutine.\n\nLe 4 mars, pour la première fois depuis plusieurs mois, le général Burkhard a pu échanger au téléphone avec son homologue russe, le général Valéri Guérassimov. La discussion a porté sur la situation au Sahel et en Europe de l’Est, en particulier sur la guerre en Ukraine. Une démarche dans les pas du Pentagone, qui a aussi annoncé, le 3 mars, avoir ouvert une « ligne de communication directe » avec l’armée russe, « dans le but de prévenir les malentendus, les incidents à caractère militaire et l’escalade ».\n\nMalgré le déclenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le chef d’état-major des armées doit continuer de veiller sur le Sahel, où la manœuvre de retrait du Mali, annoncée le 17 février par le chef de l’Etat, est complexe. « Tout est mis en œuvre pour tenir l’objectif d’un retrait en six mois, déclare-t-il, c’est un vrai défi. » « Il y aura un jour d’après à préparer au Mali, comme il y aura un jour d’après pour la Russie et l’Ukraine », ajoute-t-il. A ce stade, les effectifs militaires français n’ont pas encore baissé sur place. La bonne entente avec les forces armées maliennes (FAMA) est une des conditions de ce désengagement en bon ordre et en sécurité.\n\n\nPour réussir la réarticulation des capacités françaises vers le golfe de Guinée, ainsi que vers le Niger et le Burkina Faso, destinés à être deux pays pivots, « il faut que l’on soit capable de modifier la manière dont on a été présents jusqu’alors, insiste le général. Il y a un gros travail à effectuer avec ces Etats pour savoir comment faire et les convaincre qu’il n’y a qu’eux qui ont vraiment la réponse. Cela doit être de la coconstruction ». Un autre chantier est celui de la « guerre des perceptions », selon le général Burkhard. Des groupes de travail doivent aboutir à de premières propositions d’ici « deux ou trois mois ». « Il y a donc actuellement une nécessaire et utile phase d’incertitude », conclut-il."

Des débats sensibles, pour l’essentiel classifiés, mais bel et bien relancés, dans la perspective d’un éventuel désengagement américain du soutien à Kiev après la prise de fonctions de Donald Trump, aux Etats-Unis, le 20 janvier 2025.\n\nLe débat sur l’envoi de « troupes » en Ukraine, amorcé avec fracas par le président français, Emmanuel Macron, lors d’une réunion entre alliés de Kiev à Paris, en février, avait suscité une vive opposition de la part de certains pays européens, Allemagne en tête. Ce scénario n’a pas été enterré pour autant. Il a même repris de la vigueur ces dernières semaines, selon nos informations, à la faveur de la visite en France du premier ministre britannique, Keir Starmer, lors des cérémonies du 11-Novembre.\n\n« Des discussions sont en cours entre le Royaume-Uni et la France concernant la coopération en matière de défense, notamment dans le but de créer un noyau dur entre alliés en Europe, axé sur l’Ukraine et la sécurité européenne au sens large », confie au Monde une source militaire britannique.\n\n***« Ne pas fixer des lignes rouges »***\n\nDes propos en cohérence avec ceux tenus par le ministre des affaires étrangères, Jean-Noël Barrot,en visite à Londres, le 22 novembre. Dans un entretien accordé à la BBC, le 23 novembre, il a appelé les alliés occidentaux à « ne pas fixer et exprimer des lignes rouges » quant à leur soutien à l’Ukraine. Interrogé aussi sur la possibilité d’envoyer des troupes françaises sur le terrain, il a déclaré : « Nous n’écartons aucune option. »\n\nCôté ministère des armées et à l’Elysée, il n’y a pas de feu vert officiel, pour l’instant, à l’envoi de troupes conventionnelles ou de prestataires privés. Mais, depuis plusieurs mois, des propositions sont clairement sur la table. Comme celle de la société Défense Conseil international (DCI), le principal opérateur du ministère des armées pour le suivi des contrats d’armement tricolores à l’export et le transfert des savoir-faire militaires afférents. Dont l’Etat est actionnaire à hauteur de 55 %.\n\nComposée à 80 % d’anciens militaires, DCI serait prête à poursuivre, en Ukraine, la formation de soldats ukrainiens, comme elle le fait déjà en France et en Pologne. Elle pourrait aussi, s’il le fallait, assurer la maintenance des équipements militaires français envoyés à Kiev. DCI a été approchée en ce sens par Babcock, une société homologue britannique déjà présente en Ukraine, pour partager les installations dont cette dernière dispose. En mai, Babcock avait annoncé que des travaux étaient « encours » pour créer un site de soutien technique à l’Ukraine, « y compris la réparation et la révision des véhicules militaires », est-il écrit dans son rapport annuel.\n\nCette coopération n’a pas prospéré à ce stade, mais elle est cohérente avec la levée officielle, par l’administration Biden, le 9 novembre, de l’interdiction des sociétés militaires privées en Ukraine. Des contractors américains peuvent désormais agir à visage découvert en Ukraine, pour la maintenance des équipements militaires envoyés à Kiev, qu’ils soient issus des stocks américains ou alliés, comme les F-16 et les systèmes de défense antiaérienne Patriot.",

Il avait été interpellé en Hongrie, à deux pas de la frontière le séparant du conflit auquel il voulait prendre part [d’après Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/mort-de-martin-aramburu-le-principal-suspect-interpelle-en-hongrie-23-03-2022-GF5RDYSIGJB7XHJ65CAHI5F5LY.php?ts=1684775085018). \n\nAyant pour sa part bel et bien atteint le territoire ukrainien, César A. s’est engagé auprès du bataillon « Revanche », une formation liée au mouvement ultranationaliste orthodoxe « Tradition et Ordre » bien en vue dans certaines sphères d’extrême droite à l’international.

Un parcours qui correspond également au phénomène que Mediapart décrivait [dans un article récent](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/240423/deux-neonazis-de-retour-du-front-ukrainien-arretes-en-france) : la proximité du conflit et les facilités pour voyager dans l’espace européen permettant des allers-retours.\n\nJustement, dans la soirée du 22 avril dernier, ce sont deux néonazis qui étaient [interpellés à Paris](https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/paris-deux-militants-dextreme-droite-arretes-avec-du-materiel-militaire-a-leur-retour-dukraine-24-04-2023-GFTKQ57YZJHMDBB2A5SDOKO7BU.php?ts=1682341388501) de retour du front ukrainien. Dans leurs sacs, ils transportaient des chargeurs de fusil d’assaut et des optiques de visée classés en armes de guerre. L’un, Guillaume A. a croisé le chemin de « Kenneth » en Ukraine, au moins le temps de prendre la pose conjointement en effectuant un salut nazi. Le second, Alan V., était un ancien militaire renvoyé de l’armée après avoir été épinglé par Mediapart [dans une enquête publiée](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/080720/des-neonazis-font-carriere-dans-l-armee-francaise) en juillet 2020. Une carrière similaire à celle d’un homme que nous appellerons Paul, un autre comparse de « Kenneth » et César A., lui aussi fraîchement arrivé en Ukraine mais dont nous ignorons l’identité réelle.\n\nUn temps engagé au sein du deuxième régiment étranger parachutiste (2e REP) de la Légion étrangère, Paul appartient tout comme César A. au groupe de hooligans néonazis « Jeunesse Boulogne ». Militant politique, il est également membre du GUD Paris reformé depuis peu notamment sous la houlette de Marc de Cacqueray-Valménier, ex-leader du groupe dissous Zouaves Paris devenu en l’espace de quelques années une figure centrale de la mouvance.\n\n\n[César A., Paul et Marc de Cacqueray Valmenier en avril 2023 lors d’un entraînement sportif organisé en région parisienne ayant réuni de nombreux militants d’extrême-droite. © Document Mediapart](https://static.mediapart.fr/etmagine/article_google_discover/files/2023/05/24/20230524-img-un-neonazi-soupconne-d-avoir-agresse-un-attache-parlementaire-lfi-deguerpit-en-ukraine-3.jpg)\n\nCache-cou marqué de l’emblématique rat noir du GUD parfois remonté sur le visage, Paul a participé à la manifestation néofasciste parisienne ayant défrayé la chronique le 6 mai dernier. Sur les images, il apparaît aux côtés d’un quarteron de militants triés sur le volet au sein de la cour de l’immeuble où se terminait ce défilé. Là même où étaient également présents Axel Loustau et Olivier Duguet, les deux ex-trésoriers de Marine Le Pen dont la participation à l’événement a fait grand bruit [après les révélations de Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/politique/070523/les-deux-anciens-tresoriers-de-marine-le-pen-presents-la-manifestation-neofasciste-paris).\n\nContacté, Paul n’a pas répondu à nos questions. Interrogée sur sa carrière militaire et les éventuelles sanctions dont il aurait pu faire l’objet en raison de ses engagements, l’armée n’a pour l’heure pas donné suite à notre demande.\n\nAinsi, contrairement à la plupart des profils de Français engagés en Ukraine jusqu’alors identifiés par Mediapart et d’autres médias, César A., « Kenneth » et Paul bénéficient de liens solides au sein de divers groupuscules en France. S’ils ne forment pour l’heure qu’un contingent aux effectifs limités, leur exemple pourrait pousser d’autres militants à les rejoindre. À moyen terme, fort d’une réelle expérience de combat, l’influence qu’ils pourraient avoir sur la mouvance en cas de retour dans l’Hexagone interroge également.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nBOITE NOIRE\n\nContactés via les réseaux sociaux en date du 23 mai, César A., « Kenneth » et Paul n’ont pas répondu à nos questions.",
                "Tous le monde est content du coup non ?\n\nLe néo-nazis va pouvoir vivre ses grands rêves militaristes.\n\nLes Ukrainiens n'ont jamais trop de combattants.\n\nL'attaché parlmentaire vois son agresseur se faire condamner à une peine probablement plus grave que s'il était resté."

                " \n\n**Après un an de guerre, le leader Insoumis et ses troupes ont dû revoir certaines de leurs positions, dont celle concernant l’envoi des armes.**\n\n[La première année de guerre en Ukraine](https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/dossier/tensions-entre-la-russie-et-l-ukraine-tout-comprendre-a-la-menace-d-une-invasion-russe) a tellement bouleversé les équilibres mondiaux qu’elle a aussi affaibli les doctrines de certains responsables politiques français. [Jean-Luc Mélenchon](https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/pour-melenchon-les-riches-sont-responsables-du-malheur-des-pauvres-20230128) est de ceux-là, rattrapé de plein fouet par le réel. *«C’est un apprenti sorcier de la géopolitique. Dès la première crise qui met à l’épreuve son raisonnement, il n’y a plus personne»*, observait un responsable écologiste il y a quelques mois.\n\nJusqu’au début de la guerre, l’Insoumis avait en réalité toujours minimisé la menace militaire russe, brandie selon lui avec insistance par les États-Unis. *«Il n’est pas vrai que la Russie soit une menace pour la paix du monde. C’est un mensonge, un acte de propagande, destiné à justifier un projet politique qui est entièrement construit sur le fait qu’il faut se regrouper face à une menace qui, à mes yeux, n’existe pas»*, lançait-il lors de la campagne présidentielle de 2017, trois ans pourtant après l’annexion de la péninsule de Crimée.",
                "Je pense que c'est assez évident depuis longtemps qu'en matière de géopolitique, Mélenchon est complètement aveuglé par son anti-américanisme primaire, une tare assez classique de l'extrême-gauche française.",
                "Il est plus d'actualité maintenant, Méluche, c'est y a 7 ou 8 ans qu'il fallait s'y intéresser, maintenant c'est de la thune à jaser.",

Les USA doivent rentrer chez eux et laisser les habitants de ce continent régler leurs problèmes.",
                "Un droit de réponse de Jean-Luc Mélenchon figure à la fin de cet article*.  \n\nLa scène se passe début décembre dans les couloirs de L'Express. Après un débat tendu mais finalement fructueux avec le philosophe Raphaël Enthoven, Jean-Luc Mélenchon se laisse aller à quelques confidences. Durant deux heures, alors que les enregistreurs tournaient, le tribun a clamé avec panache son \"universalisme\", son refus des essentialismes et sa haine du racisme. Mais en off, le leader de la France insoumise livre sa vision géopolitique, aussi datée que xénophobe. \n\nMélenchon parle alors de son mépris pour ce qu'il nomme sans détour \"les Boches\". Aux yeux de Mélenchon, l'Allemagne reste l'ennemi héréditaire, qui aurait des visées hégémoniques sur l'Europe, tout en étant un cheval de Troie de \"l'ordolibéralisme\". Une rhétorique germanophobe que l'auteur du Hareng de Bismarck n'a cessé de développer ces dernières années contre ces \"teutons\" coupables d'être \"des chimistes\", des \"pollueurs\" amateurs de \"grosses bagnoles\". Bref, un \"poison de l'Europe\". Vous avez dit refus de l'essentialisme ? \n\nAujourd'hui, face à un Vladimir Poutine qui a envahi un Etat souverain et fait poindre la menace nucléaire, la principale inquiétude de Jean-Luc Mélenchon semble être le changement de doctrine de l'Allemagne en matière de défense. \"L'Ukraine ne doit pas être un prétexte pour une nouvelle course aux armements. Et surtout pas en Allemagne\", a-t-il tweeté le 26 février. Le 8 février, sur son blog, Mélenchon accusait déjà le chancelier allemand, Olaf Scholz, associé aux Américains, de saper les efforts français pour trouver une solution diplomatique à la crise ukrainienne.  \n\nRebelote le même jour : \"Deux discours dans deux couloirs, deux registres et pour ainsi dire deux vérités parallèles. Le propos de Macron est un assemblage de phrases creuses sans rapport avec les enjeux réels. Et pour cause. Pendant ce temps, les USA et l'Allemagne menaient la partie d'une nouvelle montée en tension. Dès lors, à ce moment, Macron est hors-jeu. Il ne compte pas. Poutine le sait. Et le traitement qu'il lui réserve en atteste. Le message est destiné au duo de Berlin. Et à ceux qui veulent jouer les malins.\" Tout à débusquer les stratégies sournoises de ces satanés Allemands et Américains, jamais Mélenchon n'a envisagé l'hypothèse que Vladimir Poutine, comme il l'avait depuis longtemps annoncé, ait planifié une attaque d'envergure contre l'Ukraine. \nLIRE AUSSI >> EXCLUSIF. Yuval Noah Harari : Pourquoi Poutine a déjà perdu cette guerre en Ukraine\n\nLes Etats-Unis, ou plutôt les \"Etats-Unis d'Amérique\" dans la bouche du leader de la gauche radicale, sont l'autre grande figure maléfique. Fasciné par les courants révolutionnaires sud-américains, Mélenchon n'a cessé de répéter à quel point l'impérialisme américain représenterait le principal danger dans le monde. Quitte à prendre la défense tous ses ennemis, de Hugo Chavez à Vladimir Poutine, et qu'importent leurs propres agissements. Chez Mélenchon, la diabolisation sans nuance de l'Allemagne et des Etats-Unis contraste avec sa complaisance pour le régime autoritaire de Vladimir Poutine, qu'il se refuse à qualifier de dictateur, préférant évoquer un \"autocrate\" à la \"manière de gouverner extrêmement rugueuse\".  \n\"Ce pays qui a tant de mal à en être un\"...\n\nS'il prône une sortie de l'Otan et un \"non-alignement\" , Mélenchon a régulièrement appelé à se rapprocher de Moscou. \"Si je gouvernais le pays [...], [il faudrait] construire une autre alliance et faire baisser la pression avec les Russes\", expliquait-il en 2019 sur la chaîne Thinkerview, avant d'ajouter : \"Nous faisons semblant de croire que la Russie va envahir quelqu'un, or la Russie n'a naturellement l'intention d'envahir personne, et surtout pas les pays Baltes.\" Visionnaire...  \nLIRE AUSSI >> BHL : \"Mélenchon ou Zemmour se sentent plus proches de Poutine que de leur propre pays\"\n\n\"La rhétorique anti-impérialiste, qui est profondément ancrée dans la culture politique d'une certaine gauche et d'une certaine droite, est un puissant vecteur d'adhésion à la Russie poutinienne, dont l'obsession est de se présenter comme un rempart conservateur face au néolibéralisme américain\", notait déjà le chercheur Olivier Schmitt dans Pourquoi Poutine est notre allié ?, anatomie d'une passion française (Hikari Editions, 2016), pointant une \"longue tradition\" à l'extrême gauche qui consiste à \"préférer le premier régime criminel venu aux Etats-Unis\".  \n\nChez Mélenchon, l'aveuglement idéologique face au régime de Poutine se double d'une maîtrise quelque peu approximative de la politique russe. Sur les réseaux sociaux est ainsi ressortie la vidéo d'un passage en 2017 dans L'Emission politique sur France 2. Interrogé par David Pujadas sur l'opposant Boris Nemtsov, assassiné en 2015 à quelques mètres de Kremlin, Mélenchon s'emportait alors avec morgue : \"Le personnage dont vous me parlez, avec tant de mansuétude, le connaissez-vous ? Savez-vous qui il est ? Savez-vous qu'il était un odieux antisémite ?\" Stupeur du journaliste : \"Boris Nemtsov ? Mais, enfin Jean-Luc Mélenchon, lui-même d'ascendance juive, il aurait été antisémite ? Je crois que vous confondez avec monsieur Navalny.\" \"C'est possible\", concéda Mélenchon, piteux. \nLIRE AUSSI >> Quand les souverainistes voulaient pousser la France dans les bras de Vladimir Poutine\n\nDeux ans auparavant, le même fin connaisseur des arcanes du Kremlin avait qualifié Nemtsov de \"libéral fanatique\" et de \"voyou politique ordinaire\", allant jusqu'à écrire que \"la première victime politique de cet assassinat est Vladimir Poutine\". Complotiste, il soupçonnait, sans aucune preuve, la main des Etats-Unis derrière ce meurtre, afin d'aviver les tensions avec la Russie.  \n\nSelon Olivier Schmitt, l'anti-américanisme primaire \"consiste à penser que l'intégralité des actions au sein du système international ne seraient que des réactions par rapport à ce que font les Américains. Comme les Etats-Unis sont la plus grande puissance mondiale, les autres ne se positionneraient que par rapport à eux. Quoiqu'il arrive, la cause première serait toujours les Etats-Unis. C'est une vision très réductrice, car cela enlève toute autonomie de décision propre aux acteurs locaux eux-mêmes. Dans le cas de la guerre en Ukraine, cela consiste à dire que Poutine ne fait que se défendre, mais aussi que l'Ukraine ne serait qu'un champ de bataille entre les deux empires qui s'affrontent. Comme si les Ukrainiens eux-mêmes n'existaient pas. Dans cette vision, ils ne seraient que des marionnettes, sans volonté propre.\" \n\nDans le même texte sur son blog en 2015, Jean-Luc Mélenchon ne masquait d'ailleurs pas son mépris pour l'Ukraine, ses \"nazis\" et ses soutiens américains, allant jusqu'à souhaiter la disparition de ce pays fantoche : \"Tout repose donc à présent sur le sang froid de Vladimir Poutine et des dirigeants russes. Pas de guerre ! La patience, l'écroulement de l'économie ukrainienne, la désagrégation de ce pays qui a tant de mal à en être un, tout vient à point a qui sait attendre.\" \n\n*Droit de réponse de Monsieur Jean-Luc Mélenchon \n\nL'article publié par I*Express le 1er mars 2022 sous le titre \"Quand Mélenchon souhaitait la désagrégation de I'Ukraine\" croit pouvoir qualifier la vision géopolitique de Jean-Luc Mélenchon de \"datée et xénophobe\". II s'agit d'une vision dévoyée de sa position qui doit être qualifiée de non- alignée. Cette vision géopolitique n'est pas neutre, notamment face aux violations graves du droit international que nous connaissons aujourd'hui. Les propositions de Jean-Luc Mélenchon visent avant tout à promouvoir le retour de la paix et à prémunir notre pays des engrenages guerriers. \n\nDe façon contestable, l'article ci-dessus s'appuie sur une note de blog afin de faire croire que Jean-Luc Mélenchon aurait écrit qu'iI \"souhaitait\" la désagrégation de I*Ukraine. II n'en est rien, puisque Jean- Luc Mélenchon ne faisait alors que restituer la pensée de Vladimir Poutine de l'époque. \n\nPar ailleurs, l'article ne fait pas mention de l'attachement plusieurs fois affirmé par Jean-Luc Mélenchon au principe d'inviolabilité des frontières dans le droit international, tel que cela a été le cas en 2014, au moment de l'annexion de la Crimée. II convient également de rappeler les prises de position de Jean-Luc Mélenchon condamnant très fermement l'invasion récente de l'Ukraine par le régime russe, notamment le 21 février dernier. \n\nLe 24 février, jour de l'invasion du territoire ukrainien par l'armée russe, Jean-Luc Mélenchon a constaté que \"la Russie agresse l'Ukraine\", parlant d'une \"initiative de pure violence\" et ajoutant que \"la Russie prend la responsabilité d'un recul terrible de l'histoire\".",
                "On peut aussi constater que Mélenchon reste opposé à l'envoi d'armes à l'Ukraine, après avoir flatté Poutine. Tout comme le Pen ou Zemmour, ou Ducon-Aignant.\n\nLes traîtres souverainistes. Reste à savoir si tout ces soutiens sont intéressés.",
                "Fun fact : Mélenchon apparaît dans une vidéo du compte officiel de l'Ukraine qui dénonce l'agression russe (on voit Mélenchon interviewé à Moscou par une chaîne de télé russe).\n\nIl a d'ailleurs fait un vlog où il raconte son défilé à la Place Rouge pour l'occasion en 2018. [La Russie est un partenaire, pas un adversaire !](https://youtu.be/ubIZo9hZsoU?t=1379)\n\nEDIT : le contexte -> Mélenchon s'exprime au « Défilé des immortels ». C'est une marche tous les 9 mai en Russie qui glorifie les morts de la Seconde guerre mondiale.\n\n>Immortal regiment is a state sanctioned march happening yearly. People march with flags, state symbolics and portraits of their kin who died in WWII. Looks sweet and innocent. But it conveys a powerful necrophilic message which is sublimely conveyed to the public consciousness\n\n[source](https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1503074747667603464) sur le défilé d'un thread de Kamil Galeev",

                "La centrale de Tchernobyl est maintenant sans électricité, les russes l'ont coupé...(source: Ukrenergo, l'équivalent de notre EDF national)",
                "[Une réflexion intéressante d'Andreï Kozyrev](https://twitter.com/andreivkozyrev/status/1500610676926005251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1500610676926005251%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fliveupdate%2F18hnzysb1elcs%2FLiveUpdate_ba2e4a10-9f61-11ec-aafe-22228cac32c5%2F0), ministre des affaires étrangères russes de 90 à 96 :\n\n> To understand why the invasion was rational for Putin, we have to step into his shoes. Three beliefs came together at the same time in his calculus:\n\n> 1. Ukraine’s condition. Putin spent the last 20 years believing that Ukraine is not a real nation and, at best, should be a satellite state. Maidan ended any hope of keeping Ukraine independent and pro-Kremlin. He thought the West was behind it. If Ukraine’s government cannot be kept independent and pro-Kremlin covertly, as he likely concluded, then he will overtly force it to be. He also started to believe his own propagandists that Ukraine is run by a Nazi-Bandera junta. Perfect pretext to “de-Nazify” Ukraine.\n\n> 2. Russian military. The Kremlin spent the last 20 years trying to modernize its military. Much of that budget was stolen and spent on mega-yachts in Cyprus. But as a military advisor you cannot report that to the President. So they reported lies to him instead. Potemkin military\n\n> 3. The West. The Russian ruling elite believed its own propaganda that Pres. Biden is mentally inept. They also thought the EU was weak because of how toothless their sanctions were in 2014. And then the U.S. botched its withdrawal from Afghanistan, solidifying this narrative.\n\n> If you believe all three of the above to be true and your goal is to restore the glory of the Russian Empire (whatever that means), then it is perfectly rational to invade Ukraine. \n\n> He miscalculated on all three, but that doesn’t make him insane. Simply wrong and immoral.\n\nKozyrev en conclut que Poutine est encore rationnel et n'utilisera pas l'arme atomique.",
                "Je vous partage deux articles (enfin, un article et un thread pour être précis) qui sont utiles pour comprendre la situation actuelle en Russie et comprendre l'effet des sanctions occidentales sur la Russie.\n\nLe premier article est écrit par Lukas Alpert, journaliste d'investigation qui a vécu à Moscou. Sa conclusion est que le peuple Russe soutient en majorité Putin. Il ne faut pas  s'attendre à des manifestations de masse contre la guerre. La propagande marche bien, la qualité de vie en Russie s'est largement améliorée sous Putin, le peuple russe soutient pour l'instant la guerre, puisqu'elle a jusqu'ici donne des victoires à la Russie (Tchétchénie, Géorgie, Crimée).\n\n[No one should expect the Russian people to suddenly rise up against Putin now](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-years-of-living-in-moscow-i-have-bad-news-no-one-should-expect-the-russian-people-to-suddenly-rise-up-against-putin-now-11646711445)\n\nLe deuxième article est un thread de Kamil Galeev, qui essaie de comprendre l'impact qu'aura les sanctions russes sur l'économie et la politique en Russie. Son argument principal est de dire que l'indépendance de l'économie de la Russie est un leurre, entretenue par la propagande du Kremlin. Le pouvoir politique russe est une mafia, et la base matérielle de son pouvoir provient de l'exportation de produits à faible valeur ajoutée (pétrole, gaz, charbon, potasse, blé, ...)\n\n[Let's discuss Russian economy. Many underestimate its dependency upon technological import.](https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1501360272442896388)\n\nEn réalité, la Russie est très dépendante de pays extérieurs (comprendre par là UE + Japon + US + Corée du Sud + Chine) pour ses biens intermédiaires ainsi que pour la technologie qui permet d'extraire les produits à faible valeur ajoutée.\n\nLes sanctions occidentales auront donc un vrai impact sur la société russe, mais pas forcément dans la façon dont on le pense pour l'instant. Non, le peuple russe ne va pas se révolter contre Putin. Mais oui, les sanctions peuvent porter un vrai coup à la structure du pouvoir construite par le Kremlin, et donc à la machine de guerre russe.\n\nLes sanctions occidentales vont rendre les importations de matériel technologique plus coûteuses et difficiles pour la Russie. On peut espérer maintenir l'armée russe relativement faible au moyen et long terme si les sanctions contre la Russie ne sont pas levées.",

                "**3/** D’un point de vue industriel, enfin, même en adoptant une vision étroitement nationale des intérêts français, les livraisons d’armes à l’Ukraine pourraient être envisagées comme un investissement rentable. A court terme, l’exposition médiatique des armes qui permettent aux Ukrainiens de tenir tête aux Russes constitue une publicité sans équivalent, qui ouvre des perspectives d’exportation nouvelles. Depuis leur emploi en Ukraine, les canons Caesar ont déjà suscité l’intérêt des armées lituanienne et espagnole.\n\nMais à plus long terme, surtout : il est possible que l’armée ukrainienne devienne, à l’issue de cette guerre, l’une des plus puissantes armées de terre d’Europe. Non seulement parce que l’Ukraine sera fortement incitée à entretenir d’importants moyens militaires capables de dissuader définitivement la Russie, avec le soutien de l’aide internationale ; mais aussi parce que les forces armées ukrainiennes seront fortes d’une expérience unique de combats de haute intensité qui ont déjà largement illustré leurs talents. L’Ukraine deviendra alors un acheteur d’armes incontournable et elle se tournera naturellement vers les équipements que ses soldats connaissent et ont déjà éprouvés au combat. En livrant des armes, ou en formant 10 000 soldats ukrainiens, comme le font aujourd’hui les Britanniques, nos alliés préparent aussi discrètement leurs exportations de demain. Il serait regrettable que les technologies françaises ne soient pas à ce rendez-vous.\n\nAujourd’hui, alors que l’Ukraine part à l’offensive, le débat sur l’opportunité de livrer des chars refait surface. Les Américains y pensent, les Allemands hésitent. Pour la France, un geste fort pourrait être de livrer une cinquantaine de chars Leclerc, tout en prenant en charge la formation des militaires ukrainiens. Pour ces chars, pensés dès leur conception en vue d’affronter l’armée russe, quel meilleur destin que d’entrer en libérateurs dans des villes débarrassées de leurs occupants, à l’image du maréchal du même nom ?\n\nPierre Haroche est spécialiste en sécurité européenne, chercheur invité au Centre for European Research, Queen Mary University of London.",

Il faut s'attendre à ce qu'ils soient leurs alliés indéfectibles pour les 50 ans à venir.",

                "**Le groupe français possède près de 20 % de Novatek, une importante société gazière russe réputée proche du Kremlin. BP, Shell et Equinor ont annoncé leur sortie de Russie.**\n\n\nLe groupe TotalEnergies (ex-Total) peut-il continuer à opérer en Russie, alors que plusieurs entreprises occidentales quittent déjà le pays pour protester contre la guerre en Ukraine ?\n\nSous pression du gouvernement britannique, un autre géant du pétrole, BP, a annoncé, dimanche 27 février, qu’il comptait vendre sa participation de 19,75 % du capital du groupe public russe Rosneft – deuxième producteur local de pétrole. Le directeur général de BP, Bernard Looney, a aussi démissionné du conseil d’administration de Rosneft « avec effet immédiat ». Une décision radicale et qui risque d’être coûteuse pour BP – sa participation était valorisée à 14 milliards de dollars (12,4 milliards d’euros) fin 2021.\n\n\nLundi 28 février, c’est la firme publique norvégienne Equinor (ex-Statoil) qui a annoncé mettre fin à son partenariat avec Rosneft. Equinor détient 1,2 milliard de dollars d’actifs en Russie. Une annonce suivie par le groupe anglo-néerlandais Shell, qui a interrompu son partenariat avec Gazprom en fin de journée lundi.\n\n\nContacté par Le Monde, TotalEnergies se refuse à tout commentaire sur le sujet, mais ne compte pas, pour l’heure, cesser ses engagements. La Russie est aujourd’hui la première source de production pour le groupe français : en 2020, 17 % de sa production pétrogazière se trouvait sur le territoire russe, principalement du gaz, mais aussi du pétrole – et 25 % de ses réserves également. Jeudi 24 février, cité par l’Agence France-Presse (AFP), Patrick Pouyanné, le PDG de l’entreprise, insistait plutôt sur un autre pourcentage, comme s’il s’agissait de minimiser cette importance : le marché russe constitue entre 3 % et 5 % des revenus de la compagnie.\n\n**La major française « sur la sellette »**\n\nTotalEnergies est actionnaire, à hauteur de 19,4 %, de l’entreprise russe Novatek. Cette société n’est pas publique, contrairement à Rosneft, mais elle a été fondée et reste présidée par Leonid Mikhelson, un milliardaire réputé proche du Kremlin. Des représentants de TotalEnergies siègent à son conseil d’administration.\n\nLors de l’inauguration, en décembre 2017, de l’un des grands projets du groupe russe, Yamal-LNG, une usine d’exportation de gaz à travers les eaux de l’Arctique, le président russe, Vladimir Poutine, était venu en personne saluer le rôle joué par Leonid Mikhelson, en présence de Patrick Pouyanné. TotalEnergies est d’ailleurs l’un des principaux partenaires de Novatek dans ce projet – tout comme dans un chantier gazier voisin, Arctic LNG 2, qui n’est pas encore en opération. Le projet Yamal a reçu à l’époque le soutien des autorités françaises à travers une garantie à l’exportation – alors même que la Russie était déjà sous sanction internationale, depuis 2014, pour l’invasion de la Crimée. La stratégie de Novatek et de TotalEnergies en Sibérie consiste à miser sur la fonte des glaces en Arctique pour pouvoir exporter de plus en plus de gaz naturel liquéfié (GNL) par bateau à destination de la Chine et de la Corée du Sud – une route qui n’est aujourd’hui disponible que quelques mois dans l’année.\n\n\n« TotalEnergies se trouve sur la sellette après la décision de BP et d’Equinor. Si le groupe s’accroche à la Russie, cela peut aussi tenir au fait qu’il a déjà engagé des investissements sur du long terme », considère Francis Perrin, directeur de recherche à l’Institut de relations internationales et stratégiques, à Paris.\n\nEn janvier, le groupe français avait dû annoncer son départ de Birmanie, après que Le Monde a révélé que ses activités finançaient les activités des généraux au pouvoir. « Quitter la Birmanie n’impliquait pas les mêmes conséquences qu’un éventuel départ de Russie, hypothèse qui ne paraît pas la plus vraisemblable », estime M. Perrin.\n\nPour ce qui est du gisement pétrolier de Kharyaga (Sibérie occidentale), TotalEnergies mène le projet sans implication de Novatek. Ce champ, déjà en production, est développé avec une entreprise d’Etat russe, Zarubezhneft, et – jusqu’à son futur désengagement – avec Equinor.\n\n**Les sanctions ne visent pas le secteur énergétique**\n\nContacté, le ministère français de l’économie laisse entendre qu’il ne compte pas mettre la pression sur le groupe TotalEnergies pour qu’il quitte la Russie – contrairement à l’attitude du gouvernement britannique vis-à-vis de BP. « L’entreprise doit appliquer les sanctions prises » par les pays de l’Union européenne (UE), se contente d’indiquer Bercy. Or, pour l’instant, celles-ci prennent soin de ne pas viser le secteur énergétique.\n\nUn des arguments avancés pour justifier le maintien de TotalEnergies souligne que le groupe Novatek n’est pas public, et ne peut être considéré au même titre que des entreprises directement détenues par le pouvoir russe.\n\n\nPourtant, le deuxième actionnaire de Novatek, Guennady Timchenko, est visé par les sanctions américaines et britanniques – il est proche depuis plus de vingt ans de M. Poutine, qui est notamment président honoraire de son club de fitness. Pour l’heure, M. Timchenko n’est pas concerné par les sanctions françaises ou celles de l’UE. Récipiendaire de la Légion d’honneur en 2013, il est réputé avoir permis le rapprochement entre Total et Novatek. Son intérêt pour la France est marqué : il copréside le conseil économique de la Chambre de commerce et d’industrie franco-russe avec… Patrick Pouyanné. Il possède aussi avec son épouse Elena plusieurs hôtels de luxe en France – nul ne sait pour l’heure si ces biens seront concernés par les sanctions.\n\nGuennady Timchenko et Leonid Mikhelson sont, par ailleurs, les principaux actionnaires du groupe de pétrochimie Sibur – qui comptait, jusqu’au vendredi 25 février, l’ancien premier ministre français François Fillon à son conseil d’administration.",

                "Un arrêt des importations des hydrocarbures russes, dont les ventes financent la guerre de Moscou, fait craindre au candidat de La France insoumise une forte hausse des prix de l’énergie.\n\nLes liaisons devenues dangereuses entre la France et la Russie en matière d’énergie continuent d’occuper la campagne présidentielle, et ses candidats. Elles opposent notamment Yannick Jadot et Jean-Luc Mélenchon, qui ont joué, samedi 12 mars, un nouvel épisode de leurs divergences sur le sujet.  \nInterrogé lors d’un point de presse en marge de la marche pour le climat organisée à Paris, le candidat de La France insoumise à l’Elysée a estimé que « l’embargo sur le gaz russe, ce serait une aberration ». « Les seuls qui seraient frappés par ça, c’est nous », a-t-il ajouté, qualifiant de « mignonne » l’idée selon laquelle priver Moscou de ses recettes liées aux hydrocarbures compliquerait le financement de la guerre en Ukraine.\n\n« Pourquoi Total devrait-il se retirer ? »  \nEt d’imaginer ce qui se passerait si un tel embargo était mis en œuvre :  \nLes prix explosent, les Français paient. Pourquoi, s’il vous plaît, pourquoi ferions-nous ça ? Pourquoi Total devrait-il se retirer de Russie ? Je trouve assez facile d’aller dire « on peut grelotter à la maison, c’est mieux que de trembler devant les Russes ». Ce sont les gens qui n’ont jamais grelotté de leur vie qui parlent comme ça.  \nCette dernière invective pouvait viser le ministre de l’économie, Bruno Le Maire, qui avait appelé les Français à faire un « effort » sur leur consommation d’énergie, le 7 mars sur BFM-TV. Elle pouvait aussi s’adresser à l’écoféministe Sandrine Rousseau, ancienne membre de l’équipe de campagne de Yannick Jadot, qui avait jugé possible, le 9 mars sur RMC, de se passer du gaz russe à la condition de baisser le chauffage de deux degrés dans les logements des Français.  \nUn peu plus tôt, le candidat écologiste, invité du « 13 heures » de France 2, avait dit à peu près tout le contraire de son rival « insoumis ». Le « seul moyen de pression » sur Vladimir Poutine, selon lui, est bien d’« arrêter d’importer du gaz et du pétrole \\[de Russie\\], d’organiser cet embargo » alors que « ce sont 700 millions de dollars qui alimentent chaque jour l’armée russe, qui alimentent chaque jour les crimes en Ukraine ».  \nPour compenser une telle coupure des approvisionnements, « on s’organise, on en fait un incroyable projet de société », a soutenu M. Jadot, qui veut des panneaux photovoltaïques « sur tous les toits des supermarchés, sur les toits des écoles, sur tous les toits plats », et « aider les Français à changer de chaudière pour ne plus dépendre du gaz ou du fioul ». Alors nous verrons, selon lui, que « l’écologie, c’est à la fois la paix, le climat et le pouvoir d’achat ».\n\n« Profiteurs de guerre »  \nC’est bien sous l’angle du pouvoir d’achat que Marine Le Pen a abordé la question, à l’occasion de son déplacement dans le Nord, samedi. La candidate du Rassemblement national n’a pas mentionné les sanctions contre Moscou, préférant viser les « profiteurs de guerre » qui, selon elle, gagnent de l’argent sur la hausse des cours.\n\n« Les pétroliers en profitent un peu pour se faire des marges, ça ne va pas être possible », a-t-elle affirmé sur le marché de Dunkerque, où elle a multiplié les selfies. « Quand je vois le gazole augmenter de 70 centimes en l’espace de quelques jours alors même qu’on sait que les prix sont répercutés en général sur un mois, je me dis qu’il y a des comportements suspects », a développé la candidate.  \nElle a donc demandé que le gouvernement confie une enquête à la direction générale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la répression des fraudes « pour vérifier dans quelles conditions on voit s’envoler les prix du carburant à la pompe ».  \nMarine Le Pen propose depuis l’automne une baisse de la TVA sur le gaz, l’électricité et les carburants. Face à la nouvelle flambée des prix, elle a demandé une annulation des hausses de la taxe intérieure de consommation sur les produits énergétiques décidées entre 2015 et 2018, qu’elle entend compenser en « taxant » les pétroliers. Vendredi à Bouchain, elle a aussi suggéré de supprimer la TVA sur les prix d’une centaine de produits de première nécessité.",

Les francais sont des veaux.",
                "Intéressant de voir la ligne de fracture qui au fond n'a rien à voir avec la guerre. D'un coté Jadot qui utilise l'argument de l'épouvantail de la Russie pour pousser un agenda énergétique un peu irréaliste et d'un autre, Mélenchon qui tranche en faveur du pouvoir d'achat contre l'écologie, avec un peu plus de réalisme, mais moins d'ambition. Des mauvaises langues pourraient lui prêter d'être encore une fois du coté de Moscou.\n\nJe me serais attendu à ce qu'ils sautent tous les deux à pied joint dans la même direction: \"Cette situation illustre une fois de plus qu'on doit sortir des hydrocarbures, tout court et la dépendance à la Russie est secondaire\"."

En plus une fois dans le marché commun, après la guerre, leur puissante industrie agricole va faire beaucoup de mal aux agriculteurs français.",
                "Cher Truman, \nMoi, français, pro-européen \"to a fault\", mais étant parti de Kharkov le 22 février et d'ukraine le 24 après 5 années là-bas, ayant épousé (et quitté) une femme de Lisichansk, je me sens émotionellement impliqué dans cette question particulière. Raisonnablement il y aura certainement besoin pour l'Ukraine de se reconstruire sur les standards économiques et infrastructurelles européens. La stabilité de hryvna vis à vis de l'euro et du dollar, la reconstruction post-guerre, et l'élimination de la corruption et des traffics humains et autres se fera par et avec l'europe. Nul doute. Si les américains et les britanniques sont les plus volontaires et diligents en ce qui concerne l'aide militaire, pour l'après-guerre, la stabilité et le développement du pays dans son entier, un contrat avec l'UE est d'une impérieuse nécessité. Les 50/100 milliards d'euros annuels dont l'Ukraine aura besoin pour se rebâtir et se mettre au niveau des standards européens ne pourront venir que d'une mission concertée européenne. Quant à la stabilité et à la sécurité du pays, l'Europe n'a même pas les prémices d'un accord de défense commune. Les ébauches en ce sens, en particulier venant des six membres originels.\nL'acceptation en ce sens de la candidature est une bonne nouvelle, mais le challenge pour l'Ukraine et pour l'Europe est incroyable, presque impossible si l'Ukraine ne gagne pas la guerre. La construction d'une Europe plus fédéraliste, que j'appelle de mes voeux, est très loin du compte, et l'acceptation de la pologne et de la hongrie, pas prêtes culturellement, de la bulgarie et la roumanie, pas prêtes économiquement, montrent à quel point l'Europe de libre-échange, et pas plus, voulus par les britanniques dans les années 90 et 2000 est à la rupture. \nNe comptez pas sur une adhésion à court ou moyen terme. 2040 est un minimum. Mais l'idée, que Macron a exprimé, de mettre en place un club de prétendants, en développement, me semble être une bonne idée. Avec des garanties mutuelles, des investissements, et une libre circulation des biens et personnes, au-delà du schéma des 3 mois comme avant la guerre.\nLa police pourrie jusqu'à la moëlle, les politiques ouvertement corrompus et les diverses mafias sans foi ni loi seront des obstacles très sensibles à une intégration européenne plus avancée. Je les ai expérimentés tous et toutes. En Ukraine d'avant guerre, tout s'achetait auprés même des autorités, êtres humains compris.\nAutre problème, celui-ci dû à la guerre, est le nationalisme, qui nécessaire aujourd'hui pour repousser l'agression, va laisser des marques qui seront difficilement cohabitables avec les idéaux de l'Europe.\nBeaucoup de chantiers qui prendront beaucoup de temps, d'où la nécessité de trouver un moyen de garantir la sécurité militaire, économique et humaine de l'Ukraine en attendant 🤞 une adhésion complète.",
                "Je suis partagé.  D'un côté le pays n'est clairement pas prêt (socialement et économiquement) et si le processus d'adhésion normal est respecté,  ils mettront des années voir décennies à l'être. \n\nDe l'autre, la Russie a abandonné tout faux-semblants et ne cache même plus son ambition d'annexer tout le pays (réécriture de l'histoire pour dire qu'ils n'étaient qu'un seul peuple, probablement séparé par les méchants occidentaux impérialistes et colonisateurs, Medvedev qui dit en pleine conférence de presse \"qui sait si l'Ukraine existera encore dans 2 ans, . . .).\n\nDonc on se retrouve avec un pays qui ne remplie clairement pas les conditions pour rentrer dans l'ue,  mais qui ne peut pas se permettre le temps de les remplir. La proposition de Macron de créer un nouveau statut aurait pu être une solution imparfaite, mais les remarques contre une \"Europe a 2 vitesses\" étaient tout autant justifiées. \n\nSi il fallait absolument choisir pour ou contre, je serai pour. Mais aucune des 2 situations n'est idéale et c'est clairement un choix de réaction forcé par Poutine. Je n'aime pas non plus les implications par rapport aux pays Baltes et la Georgie.  Sans avoir de troupe russes aux fesses, ils sont dans une situation similaire en ce qui concerne la Russie (anciens pays Soviétique que Poutine voudrait probablement re absorber). Doit ont les accueillir tout de suite dans l'UE aussi,  ou va t'on laisser des pays disparaître après s'être battu pour l'Ukraine?"

Une opération inédite.\n\nLa livraison aura fait l’objet de longues tractations. Selon nos informations, la France s’apprête à fournir à l’Ukraine une nouvelle série de canons Caesar, prélevés sur une commande destinée à l’origine au Danemark. Cet approvisionnement pourrait porter sur 6 à 12 obusiers sur les quinze demandés par Kiev. Si les discussions techniques sont en cours de finalisation, la manœuvre fait l’objet d’un accord politique de principe entre les trois gouvernements. Celui-ci a été trouvé lors d’échanges intervenus ces dernières semaines entre le président, Emmanuel Macron, son homologue ukrainien, Volodymyr Zelensky, et la première ministre danoise, Mette Frederiksen.\n\nL’opération est à la fois inédite et complexe pour les autorités françaises. Les équipements que Paris s’engage à livrer à Kiev étaient d’abord destinés au Danemark, dans le cadre d’une commande de 15 unités passée en 2017, complétée par 4 autres canons en 2019, en cours de livraison par leur fabricant Nexter. Copenhague aurait d’autant plus accepté, à ce stade, de renoncer à une partie de ces matériels qu’ils sont encore en cours de validation technique, voire pas tous conformes au cahier des charges fixé initialement par les Danois. Après avoir hésité, l’Ukraine, dont les dirigeants se félicitent de l’efficacité des Caesar, est prête à récupérer ces matériels et à les utiliser en l’état. Ni l’Elysée ni le ministère des armées n’ont souhaité commenter l’opération.\n\nAlerté par son état-major, Emmanuel Macron aurait en tout cas renoncé à prélever de nouveaux Caesar dans le parc de l’armée française, déjà diminué par la livraison de 18 canons au printemps et au début de l’été : le contingent envoyé en Ukraine représente près du quart de la dotation de l’armée de terre, fixée à 76 unités. Kiev n’y perd d’ailleurs pas au change. Si les Caesar danois sont d’un modèle plus lourd que ceux de l’armée française (32 tonnes contre 18 tonnes), ils sont plus puissants : montés sur 16 roues au lieu de 12, ils peuvent emporter jusqu’à 36 obus au lieu de 18, et leur cabine est dotée d’un blindage plus protecteur. « Le Caesar est l’outil parfait pour faire de la contrebatterie, pour repérer et pour détruire l’artillerie ennemie avant qu’elle-même ne vous détecte », souligne une source militaire.",

Aujourd’hui, Paris ne pèse rien dans le conflit, personne ne parle des armements français en dehors des Caesar ! », s’agace François Heisbourg, conseiller pour l’Europe de l’Institut international d’études stratégiques.\n\nIl est gentil François, mais on peut difficilement faire plus d'après ce que j'ai compris.",

And they are trying to avoid responsibility and put it to the officers in a hopeless situation who have to conduct a political project poorly organized by the top leadership,\" he writes.\n\n>The problem is that instead of training new fighters and replenishing existing brigades which already have experienced leadership, Zelensky came up with a plan for our NATO allies to form 14 new brigades, for the creation of which there were no commanders and leader stuff, says ButusovL\n\n  \nLe plus gros des désertions a eu lieu avant même l'envoi en France :\n\n>Due to poor organization, during the spring and summer, the brigade experienced massive desertion; by the time the brigade left for training in France in October, the desertion had reached almost 1,000 people, “so it was clear that this would continue in France,” he notes\n\n  \nRésultat, la \"brigade\" envoyé pour l'entraînement ne vaut pas grand chose :\n\n>“So, the command of the OC “West” sent to France not an organized and managed military unit that could learn a lot, but a crowd of new people just dressed in military uniforms,” the journalist notes.\n\nEt je vous passe tout le reste du fait qu'une partie des troupes manquantes a été remplacé et formé en Ukraine, et que le commandement avait été donné à une personne expérimentée qui avait de l'expérience militaire, Dmytro Ryumshin, mais que lorsque celui-ci est revenu de l'entrainement en France, il a été inculpé à cause des désertions de masses qui avaient eu lieu avant le départ.\n\n  \nUn beau zbeul.",

Le plus gros problème à noter ici est que Butusov n'a aucune preuve pour ses affirmations et ne fournit aucune source pour son histoire. Littéralement zéro. Je prendrais donc cette histoire avec un énorme grain de sel.  \n\n\nSi elle est vraie, elle doit être aussi comprise dans son contexte: Les brigades urkainiennes sont rarement composées uniquement de soldats professionnels, mais plutôt d'un mélange de professionnels et de conscrits. La grande majorité des désertions se produisent dans les groupes de conscrits et non chez les professionnels. La Brigade Anne de Kiev comptait environ 2000 soldats ukrainiens PROFESSIONNELS formés en France, dont aucun conscrit."

                " **Les Etats-Unis s’engagent à fournir à l’Ukraine des armes à sous-munitions, malgré l’impact pour les civils**\n\nWashington n’a jamais signé la Convention d’Oslo de 2008 interdisant l’utilisation et le transfert de ces armes ravageuses pour la population, y compris après la fin des conflits. \n\nL’intérêt militaire immédiat supplante parfois les considérations éthiques et humanitaires. En décidant, après de longues hésitations, de fournir à l’Ukraine des armes à sous-munitions, l’administration Biden répond à une demande pressante de Kiev.\n\nCe feu vert, confirmé vendredi 7 juillet par le conseiller à la sécurité nationale, Jake Sullivan, s’inscrit dans le cadre d’[un nouveau paquet massif d’aide militaire](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3451570/biden-administration-announces-additional-security-assistance-for-ukraine/) accordée à l’Ukraine par Washington, d’un montant de 800 millions de dollars (730 millions d’euros).\n\nLa Maison Blanche conçoit ces bombes à sous-munitions comme une façon de parer au plus pressé, pour maintenir l’effort de livraisons constant à Kiev. L’incapacité du complexe militaro-industriel à exécuter les commandes dans un temps court et la réduction inquiétante des stocks de munitions de l’armée a obligé l’administration à utiliser cet expédient très controversé, en raison des dégâts immédiats et à long terme sur les civils.\n\n*« Nous avons déjà vu des hausses substantielles de production,* a expliqué Jake Sullivan. *Mais ce processus va continuer à réclamer du temps et il sera essentiel d’assurer à l’Ukraine un pont de livraison*s. (…) *Nous avons retardé la décision autant que nous le pouvions.* (…) *C’est le moment de commencer la construction de ce pont pour qu’à aucun moment cet été ou bien au début de l’automne l’Ukraine ne se retrouve à court d’artillerie. »*\n\nLe conseiller a insisté sur le fait que l’Ukraine n’utiliserait pas ces armes à sous-munitions *« sur une terre étrangère »,* mais pour défendre son territoire*,* et qu’elle a pour objectif de préserver le plus possible sa population civile. Un indice trahissant l’inconfort américain : Jake Sullivan a même évoqué l’existence *« d’assurances écrites »* fournies par Kiev sur l’emploi mesuré de ces armes, une garantie de papier à la valeur relative. Comment déterminera-t-on cette mesure, avec des bombes aussi indiscriminées ? En revanche, elles offriront selon les spécialistes une marge de manoeuvre inédite en matière d’artillerie à l’armée ukrainienne, jusqu’à présent contrainte à une économie de tirs face aux Russes.\n\n**Remous au sein de l’OTAN**\n\nLe terme d’« arme à sous-munitions » implique la dispersion imprécise sur un champ vaste de sous-munitions pesant chacune moins de 20 kilogrammes, larguées par avion ou par le truchement de batteries de missiles. Certaines explosent aussitôt, d’autres plus tard. [Conclue en 2008, la convention d’Oslo interdisant l’utilisation et le transfert de ces armes](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2008/12/03/une-centaine-de-pays-signent-un-traite-interdisant-les-bombes-a-sous-munitions_1126252_3210.html) n’a pas été signée par les Etats-Unis, ni par la Russie ou la Chine, contrairement à près de 120 Etats. Le texte prévoyait notamment la destruction des stocks, la dépollution des zones contaminées par les restes non explosés et l’organisation d’une assistance aux victimes.\n\nLa convention rappelait en préambule que *« les restes d’armes à sous-munitions tuent ou mutilent des civils, y compris des femmes et des enfants, entravent le développement économique et social, y compris par la perte des moyens de subsistance, font obstacle à la réhabilitation et à la reconstruction post-conflit, retardent ou empêchent le retour des réfugiés et des personnes déplacées à l’intérieur de leur propre pays ».*\n\nLes Etats-Unis assurent que les munitions livrées seront prises sur les stocks dont le taux d’échec moyen – créant ainsi des bombes ravageuses à retardement – ne dépasse pas 2,35 % selon le Pentagone. La Russie, elle, a dispersé *« des dizaines de millions »* de ces sous-munitions sur le territoire ukrainien depuis le début de la guerre, avec des taux de non-explosion de 30 % à 40 %, a rappelé Jake Sullivan. [Comme l’expliquait en mars 2022 une synthèse du Service de recherche du Congrès](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/RS22907.pdf) des Etats-Unis, il existe souvent un écart entre le taux affiché par les fabricants et celui relevé par les démineurs sur le terrain, lors d’opérations longues et complexes.\n\n*« L’Ukraine se trouve au milieu d’une contre-offensive qui ne se passe pas aussi bien que prévu,* souligne Charles Kupchan, professeur de relations internationales et expert au cercle de réflexion Council on Foreign Relations. *C’est donc un moment crucial sur le champ de bataille. L’administration Biden essaie d’en faire autant que possible en soutien de l’Ukraine sur le court terme. J’ai le sentiment qu’elle s’est débattue avec cette décision depuis un moment, en partie parce que les Etats-Unis et les alliés sont préoccupés par la perception, les considérations éthiques d’un tel transfert. La volonté américaine de préserver une sorte de supériorité morale est une des raisons pour lesquelles cette décision a été si difficile à prendre. »*\n\nA quelques jours du sommet de l’OTAN à Vilnius, cet arbitrage délicat de Joe Biden suscite logiquement des remous entre les membres de l’Alliance atlantique, mais aucune critique directe n’a été émise contre Washington. *« Nous avons le sentiment que d’aucune façon, cela n’affectera la très forte unité entre alliés »,* a indiqué Jake Sullivan, qui a mis en avant des consultations préalables avec certains partenaires clés. Coïncidence, qui n’en est certainement pas une : la Maison Blanche a diffusé vendredi après-midi un communiqué pour indiquer que les Etats-Unis avaient détruit le dernier stock d’armes chimiques à sa disposition, appelant la Russie à déclarer et éliminer son programme non déclaré. Une façon d’indiquer, par ce moment symbolique, que Washington ne s’inscrit pas dans une course débridée à tous les armements, sans considération pour les conséquences.\n\n**Mise sous tension des stocks des alliés**\n\nLa décision de l’administration Biden rappelle une nouvelle fois la mise sous tension des stocks des alliés, après un effort sans précédent et non anticipé depuis février 2022, aux côtés de l’Ukraine. Aux Etats-Unis, la question des investissements, des priorités à accorder en matière d’armements, est aussi posée. *« Si nous avions assez d’obus classiques, nous ne serions pas obligés d’envoyer des bombes à sous-munitions,* explique Jon Wolfsthal, ancien membre du Conseil de sécurité nationale sous Barack Obama et conseiller auprès de l’organisation Global Zero, qui plaide pour une dénucléarisation du monde. *Le Pentagone dépense beaucoup d’argent sur les armes nucléaires, les chasseurs de cinquième génération, les sous-marins et des armes compliquées. Or il apparaît que nous avions besoin de production d’artillerie. Nous avons semble-t-il fait de mauvais paris. Nous voilà avec de nombreuses armes inutilisables et dépourvus de celles dont nous avons besoin. »*"

Volodymyr Zelensky craignait, mardi soir, que la Russie ne profite de l'occasion pour lancer de nouvelles offensives. D'ailleurs, dans les premières heures de ce 24 août, des explosions ont retenti dans plusieurs villes, comme Kharkiv (Nord-Est), Zaporijia et Dnipro (Centre), selon les autorités locales. Mais, pour autant, le président ukrainien reste déterminé à gagner cette guerre contre la Russie et à ne rien lui concéder  \n>  \n>Mercredi, dans un discours à la nation à l'occasion du Jour de l'indépendance de son pays, Volodymyr Zelensky a déclaré : « Nous allons nous battre pour \\[notre terre\\] jusqu'au bout. » Et d'ajouter : « Nous tenons bon depuis six mois. C'est dur, mais nous avons serré les poings et nous nous battons pour notre destin. » « **Pour nous, l'Ukraine, c'est l'Ukraine tout entière. Toutes les 25 régions, sans aucune concession ni compromis** », a-t-il poursuivi.  \n>  \n>« Qu'est-ce qui est pour nous la fin de la guerre ? Avant, on disait “la paix”. Maintenant, on dit “la victoire”. Nous n'allons pas chercher à nous entendre avec les terroristes » russes, a martelé Volodymyr Zelensky.",

Perhaps Biden doesn't want a sanction induced cost of living crisis during the mid terms, who knows. \n\nAmerica has a big strategic interest in Taiwan, in that it is a battle ground between America's only peer competitor in an area of the world where American economic interests are far from guaranteed. Were America to let Taiwan fall, that'd be the end of pax Americana and America's presence in the pacific. Not true for Ukraine and American presence in Europe.\n\nIf Ukraine returns to the Russian sphere of influence (where it has been from the end of the cold war to 2014) then America and Europe lose nothing. US-EU trade will continue, Nato will remain strong in Poland and the Baltics, and if anything might be strengthened. \n\nAt the country level, Ukraine and Taiwan couldn't be more different. Taiwan is a functioning, advanced, law governed democracy with regular, legitimate elections. Ukraine is a basket case economy [run by oligarchs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/taming-ukraines-oligarchs/), [which currently has the leader of the main opposition party under house arrest](https://www.euronews.com/2021/05/13/ukraine-opposition-leader-and-putin-ally-under-house-arrest-after-being-charged-with-treas) and [shuts down opposition media](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-zelenskiy-bans-three-opposition-tv-stations/a-56438505). The arrests and the media shutdowns may or may not be justified, but they are hardly the examples of a free or democratic country. \n\nPutin's invasion of Ukraine is an undoubted crime, but doesn't fundamentally challenge any core American interest.

Also, there was a picture of an Ukrainian using Type 95 Assault rifles, most likely from Pakistan. In fact, the Chinese have sold tanks to both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict and others that used soviet caliber.\n\nI would not be overly concerned about this. The shell has been produced 5 decades ago. I would be suicidal to operate and fire it. As long as the more modern stuff they currently export remains away from the Russians we should be good.",

I just want to bring some awareness to some of the narratives being spread. \n\nI came across this popular video that is trending on the front page of Bilibili (China's equivalent to YouTube) and it perfectly sums up their narrative and talk points. The video not only regurgitates the Kremlin's narrative, but it also adds this very skewed and dangerous worldview where the West is on a crusade to subjugate and enslave the Chinese race and civilization. In that narrative, Russia is basically trying to break free of the Anglo Saxon + Jewish subjugation, and is trying to protect the Russian people and Russia against the West's corruption. The video propagates that democracy is a corrupting tool to weaken and damage Russian and Chinese civilizations and that people must not be swayed by the \"color revolutions\" and Western human rights activists. The video goes on to spread many fake news particularly regarding the international sanctions against Russia, and putting a racial spin on everything. That the West is using this war to demonize the whole Russian race, and the sanctions are put on all Russians even including the pro democracy Russian dissidents living in the West. That  the racism and oppression against Russians and Chinese are what Putin is fighting against. The talk points and disinformation goes on and on.\n\nI highly recommend people to visit the links listed below, just auto translate the entire page and read through the comments underneath the videos to get a deeper insight into this insular and scary parallel universe.\n\nthe video mentioned above: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14b4y1s7gM](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14b4y1s7gM)\n\nThis popular video \"teaches\" Chinese people how to filter information regarding the war. Basically the narrative is that all Western media are fake news and are out to get you, so the Chinese firewall is there to protect you: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12q4y147bL/?spm\\_id\\_from=333.788.recommend\\_more\\_video.2](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12q4y147bL/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.2)\n\nThis video shows how the Russian Chechen forces are rescuing trapped Ukrainian children.

The comments on this video give a perfect representation of how China views Western media: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15F411x7v8/?spm\\_id\\_from=333.788.recommend\\_more\\_video.7](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15F411x7v8/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.7)\n\nThere is also this sick sexual fascination and objectification of Ukrainian women that has been very common and popular on Chinese social media for many years. Some of the popular narratives on this was that \"Ukrainian women are beautiful but poor so now that we're rich lets go and buy them all\", or \"Ukrainian women now realize that Chinese men and China are superior to the West\". This phenomenon has started to be controlled and many videos were deleted due to the discovery and attention by some outside media, but you can still find this sick objectification and crazy jingoism common in comments of the videos when you search \"Ukrainian wife\" or \"Ukrainian beautiful women\". Interesting side note is that a lot of Ukrainian women (also just white women in general) who can speak Chinese also play into this willingly to appeal to the Chinese audience.\n\nUkrainian wife: [https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AA%B3%E5%A6%87&from\\_source=webtop\\_search&spm\\_id\\_from=333.788](https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AA%B3%E5%A6%87&from_source=webtop_search&spm_id_from=333.788)\n\n\"Ukrainian beauties\": [https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%B3&from\\_source=webtop\\_search&spm\\_id\\_from=333.788](https://search.bilibili.com/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%B3&from_source=webtop_search&spm_id_from=333.788)\n\nAll the propaganda and fake news follows the same narrative, and all the trending videos and posts on popular social media sites reinforce that narrative. Meanwhile the Western media is oblivious and complacent to the stuff that CCP is spreading internally and externally (on YouTube in Chinese), which is the complete opposite to the innocence and neutrality act that Chinese diplomats plays on the international stage. Everyone is so afraid of being called a racist, but China doesn't have such worries. The CCP seems to be setting their people up for an ideological and civilizational confrontation with the West and with democracy. This war in Ukraine right now will look like a child's play when China is ready to flip the table and take on the rules based world order full on.",

It's been only three weeks since its first post, but the account today has about 300 posts and more than 60,000 followers. **It's also mentioned in Switzerland's paper of record Neue Zürcher Zeitung, and the Chinese versions of Voice of America and DW News.**\n\nThe Great Translation Movement is also drawing a different kind of attention — criticism from the Chinese establishment.\r  \n\r  \n**State-run media have called the tweets a \"smear campaign\" against the Chinese**, since the majority of the account's posts highlight inaccurate information, or China's Russian sympathies.\r  \n\r  \n\"What kind of people are behind the 'Great Translation Movement'? Why do they see only hatred and negative messages from Chinese internet in their eyes?\" China's state-run paper Global Times wrote last week. \r  \n\r  \nIn response, the anonymous owners of the account said they choose to publish the most popular or viral posts or comments to \"convey the thoughts of the Chinese masses as precisely as possible.\" \r  \n\r  \n**The rapid rise of The Great Translation Movement is indicative of Western appetite to understand China's biases through the accessible lens of social media posts.** Experts cautioned, however, against over-relying on online sentiment to indicate what a 1.4 billion-strong population thinks.  \n\"We do have an information gap between China and the West, and not many social media users in the West are able to dive into Weibo and grasp the Chinese online sentiments and expressions,\" said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State University who's fluent in Mandarin and Russian, of the account's popularity.  \nBut, she added, the account makes some of its own editorial decisions, \"picking very provocative posts, which are attention-grabbing.\"\n\nThe operators behind The Great Translation Movement declined to provide their identities to Insider, and have publicly remained anonymous."

Whether you agree with him or not, the real gist of Tucker Carlson’s argument has been that getting bogged down in a war with Russia when Ukraine has no strategic relevance to the US is a distraction (of course he is wrong about that and he’s too sympathetic towards Putin’s victim blaming tactics), but his point has been that the real threat is China - I bet CCTV didn’t mention that lol.\n\nA lot of people have been saying for a long time now that military attention needs to shift to China and away from Russia. This war massively helps China in as much as America was in the process of very publicly shifting its focus to China and away from Eastern Europe and now their focus is very publicly shifting back to Eastern Europe. I think what too many people are missing (both on the left and the right) is that this is a two headed beast and has been for some time now. The solution to this is that Europe starts pulling its own weight militarily. The UK for example now only has about 70,000 active soldiers in the army and they were due to make further cuts this year before all this kicked off. That’s not enough troops to retake and hold one major city let alone a country. It’s a joke. Europe needs to spend more on its own defence, be it collectively or at a state by state level. It has the wealth, man power and technological know how to put together a force that would collectively rival anyone but European politicians just don’t want to spend money on defence.",

            "text": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the biggest thing that happened in 2022. It was an invasion that violated international law. What's more important is that Russia has committed many war atrocities. At a time when progress in this war is still possible, I think it's highly understandable for many people to prefer an ending in which the bully is defeated. But I have a big worry, that is, I have also seen domestic support for Trump in the United States, and many sentiments that do not support continued assistance to Ukraine are also growing. Well, as a Chinese I think it's okay, just a foreign, and there is the one of the poorest places in Europe losing a small part of its own rule.\n\nBut what I am more worried about is: if Americans continue to consume their domestic enthusiasm for foreign things, what kind of help can China's democracy receive from the outside in further? You may not know that the CCP’s internal suppression is very surprising. Before the trade war, the United States almost condoned various unfair international trade competition behaviors of the CCP, and even condoned commercial and technical espionage. This is very strange,but there is obviously a reason, because China has long been the largest trading partner of the United States. Chinese workers can tolerate very low wages but produce a lot. Ukraine is not the most important thing in my life, but the long-term peace disaster caused by the CCP, including their internal suppression, unemployment rate, and poverty, are very serious. From a righteous point of view, letting the worst dictatorship on earth collapse is also more important than the territory of Ukraine (I saw a lot of people on reddit saying I was hypocritical for thinking so, and then they blocked me), if If the CCP invades Taiwan, the entire world will be affected far more than the war in Ukraine. The CCP is also facing significant economic pressure now, because reforms forced by external forces are possible. This is not the first time for the United States.\n\nI don’t want to be called a hypocrite on reddit just for saying a few words about human rights in my own country and my concerns about the domestic situation in the United States. This is very unreasonable.\n\nWhat do you think? r/China? Do you care about China's politics? In this sub, do you only care about the Chinese girlfriends you see in life or \"China's trade competitiveness with the United States is declining?\" so you will be optimism ?If you are Americans, would you rather continue to support the fight against CCP after the war in Ukraine is over(with the possibly recession) , just like you support Ukraine?\n\nThis is an honest question that troubles my conscience",

                "nonpaywall: merica has long believed that helping Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion was not only essential to preserving the security of Europe, but also important to deterring China from invading Taiwan. On July 28th it took that reasoning a leap forward by announcing it would for the first time start to arm Taiwan from America’s own military stocks, as it has done repeatedly for Ukraine. The main difference is that it has not invoked an “emergency” to justify the move. Instead, it believes the arms supplies will help forestall a war across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe military move may instead provoke a new crisis. China will not accept American claims that it is nothing out of the ordinary, and represents “no change” in America’s Taiwan policy. After all, America is shifting from selling weapons to Taiwan to subsidising its armed forces. Even before the announcement, a Chinese defence-ministry spokesman denounced arms supplies to Taiwan as “malicious acts”, saying they posed “a serious threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and created significant strategic risks in China-us military relations”.\n\nThe question is whether, as in the past, China will show its anger by stepping up its military harassment of Taiwan, such as its daily testing of Taiwanese defences by flying close to its airspace and sailing near its territorial waters. Last year China fired salvos of missiles close to the self-governing island following a high-profile visit by Nancy Pelosi, the then Speaker of America’s House of Representatives. America has repeatedly accused China of carrying out dangerous manoeuvres close to its ships and planes, raising the risk of collision and superpower escalation.\n\nThe White House offered few details of the arms, worth $345m, to be supplied through the fast-track “presidential drawdown authority” (pda). It said only that it would provide “defence articles and services” as well as “military education and training”. A Pentagon spokesman said the package would include unspecified anti-armour and anti-aircraft weapons, as well as “multi-domain awareness” (mq-9A surveillance drones, according to leaks). More such military aid may soon follow, given that Lloyd Austin, the defence secretary, has said he intends to use the full $1bn authorised by Congress before the current fiscal year ends on September 30th.\n\nThe attempt to play down the move—by burying the announcement in legalese and issuing it late on a Friday, classically a means of burying awkward news—betrays a certain trepidation in the administration of President Joe Biden. He faces at least three sets of conflicting pressures.\n\nFirst is the worry about provoking a new crisis with China, having sent a succession of senior officials to talk to their Chinese counterparts since May. They include Jake Sulivan, the national security adviser; Antony Blinken, the secretary of state; Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary; and John Kerry, the climate envoy. All, in their various ways, have sought to create a “floor” under Sino-American relations. But military-to-military communications are still all but non-existent. “The Department of Defence continues to seek open communication with Beijing,” the Pentagon said, adding that it would “continue to support Taiwan’s maintenance of a sufficient self-defence capability.”\n\nAgainst this effort is the countervailing pressure from Congress, especially Republicans, who accuse Mr Biden of being too soft on China and getting little in return for his diplomatic outreach. Indeed, some believe the president has delayed the Taiwan pda for fear of upsetting the Chinese—a claim that American officials vehemently reject.\n\nThird, Mr Biden must satisfy Ukraine’s pressing need for more weapons as its counter-offensive progresses slowly and its cities are repeatedly pounded by Russian missiles and drones. After a wave of attacks on Odessa, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, urged the world to create a “full-fledged sky shield” over Ukraine. “We need more air-defence systems for our entire territory, for all our cities and communities. The world must not get used to Russian terror,” he wrote in a Telegram post.\n\nThe Biden administration has hitherto claimed it could “walk and chew gum” at the same time: that is, help push back Russia’s onslaught while deterring China. Even as it has rallied European allies to help Ukraine defend itself, the administration has been weaving a variety of mini-alliances in the Indo-Pacific to constrain China. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin have been criss-crossing the Pacific this week to strengthen the geopolitical “latticework”. In Brisbane on July 29th they are expected to announce a further tightening of the military alliance with Australia, including the upgrading of military bases in the country, more deployments of American forces, deeper defence-industrial ties and greater military co-operation with other countries in the region.\n\nTypically military supplies for Ukraine have been donated from American stocks—this week it announced its 43rd PDA for Ukraine, worth $400m and bringing the total to $24bn—whereas Taiwan has bought its arms under the lengthier Foreign Military Sales system. The Pentagon says the Taiwan package will not affect supplies for Ukraine. Yet Ukraine and Taiwan are now competing for American donations and, in some cases, the same weapons, too. The backlog of Taiwanese orders, which stands at more than $14bn, includes contracts for the Javelin missile, used to stop tanks, and the Stinger, used to bring down aircraft. Large quantities of both have been supplied to Ukraine.\n\nIn contrast with the PDAs for Ukraine, Congress has not appropriated funds needed to replenish weapons being given to Taiwan. In the short term the Pentagon can probably re-allocate funds internally, say congressional staffers. But for the new Taiwan policy to be sustainable, Congress will have to appropriate money in the next fiscal year. That, in turn, will depend on the tortuous budgeting process in a divided Congress, especially the House, where “America First” admirers of Donald Trump, who are sceptical if not hostile towards Ukraine, hold greater sway.\n\nAssuming Congress can agree on a budget on time, Mr Biden will probably face demands for even stronger measures to help Taiwan, including grants to buy weapons and more intense training. After all, one of the few issues on which Mr Biden’s political supporters and foes can agree is the need to confront China. Some senior figures worry that such unanimity may prove an even greater danger than political dissension.",

The latest war of words comes days after Washington claimed Chinese state-owned firms are helping Russia in the ongoing invasion.\n\nRubbishing the allegations, the country’s Foreign Ministry said that the US should stop sending weapons to Ukraine if it is so concerned to see the war ended. The ministry also clarified, that China, unlike the US, “*would never add fuel to the fire, still less exploit the crisis*“. \n\nMoreover, Beijing insisted that the Biden Administration is trying to victimize Chinese firms by *“sowing paranoia and pointing fingers at China*“.\n\n>***“The US is the one who started the Ukraine crisis and the biggest factor fueling it.

As Chinese living in a country which has also been invaded by great powers in the past, everyone should understand the pain of being invaded by a vastly militarily superior country. In my opinion this is indeed an act of invasion; the reason for the attack is simple: because Ukraine was getting too close to countries Russia didn’t like, and considering joining their supranational organizations. Who knew that Ukraine is an independent, sovereign country (sarcasm)—who they’re close to, what organizations they join should be a right of sovereign independent countries. This is like our daily personal relationships: who someone is close to is one’s own choice, and you can’t just beat someone up for hanging out with someone you don’t like, could you justify that?\n\nIf we’re all cheering on Russia and supporting them now, what’s the difference between us and someone who supported the invasion of our country by Japan back then?\n\nI don’t know why I said all this, but I felt uneasy in my heart not saying it. Actually, often there are good fans that will tell me not to be so honest from time to time, go with the mainstream opinion, and follow the views of the majority of netizens—this way I can get a bigger audience. I also was determined to do this, but sometimes I really can’t resist but say some incriminating words.",

We even had arguments because they claim that that COVID is a product of America’s laboratory. However they quieted down during this couple of days because they are forced to quarantined in their home without any food or water. They seem to “woken up” to the tyranny of China because they keep criticising the government. Even so, I find it hard to empathise with them considering the things they said before. I just wonder would they revert back to their old ways once the quarantine is lifted.",

                "Ambivalent. \n\nOne of the defining traits of a successful totalitarian state is an ironclad stranglehold on its citizens' minds, to the point where 2+2=5. Yeah, yeah, Orwellian terminology is overused, but I never saw such clear examples of doublethink in real life before I began following Chinese affairs. It was pretty shocking. So yes, I would describe China as a totalitarian country, and yes, I subsequently expect the government to hold a tight grip on its citizens' minds. For us Westerners, the absurdity and oppression is obvious, but we're on the outside looking in. Totalitarian control is more than just the blunt force of a boot stomping on a face forever; it's far more insidious than that. True control is putting the boot in the mind, stomping down dissident thought patterns--not because you're afraid to think dissident thoughts, but because it literally doesn't occur to you. If you grew up believing the stories your native media tells, why would you suddenly switch to believing foreign media when it claims that your native news is lying and your government is committing terrible deeds? That's just one example, but you get the idea. \n\nBeyond that, I think there's some psychological incentive to believe what the government says. Who wants to believe that their country is committing atrocities? Hell, look at how many people in the US get their panties in a twist when folks say, \"Hey, maybe we should talk about *past* shittiness in America.\" And even if you do believe, what can you do? You'll get censored for just posting sympathy for Hong Kong, and much worse if, God forbid, you actually take action. So why bother? Besides, do you *really* want to disturb the government that has provided so much stability and prosperity? Do you *really* want to go back to the age of warlords? It's so much easier to just nod and smile. But nodding and smiling on the surface is a slippery slope to nodding and smiling in the soul.\n\nSo the government has a tight grip on people's minds, so tight that many don't even realize it. In that situation, it takes a severe shock to shake people out of complacency. And that's what we're seeing right now. Better late than never, right? At least people are waking up and realizing that the pot is boiling, *has* been boiling for years.\n\nBut on the flipside...complacency is consent. And a lot of Chinese are *more* than just complacent. Maybe not the majority, but certainly enough to extend the reach of the CCP into other countries. Many of the little pinks who harass non-Chinese netizens are living outside of China. You regularly get stories of bullying on *foreign* campuses, where Chinese students who don't toe the party line get attacked by other Chinese students...and God help you if you're a Uyghur kid. You know, there are plenty of other authoritarian states with censored media, shitty schools, etc., where people are canny enough to see though the lies their government tells. There are plenty of immigrants and students from dictatorial countries who are willing to listen to alternative views, even if they don't always agree with them. Why are Chinese citizens so different? In that context, this new awareness seems profoundly selfish, and I have to wonder how long it will last.\n\nSo I'm ambivalent. I understand how insidious state-sponsored brainwashing can be, and I'm glad to see people shaking it off. But I can't help but wonder how genuine this sentiment is. It depends on what happens in the future--will people hold onto this perspective after the quarantine lifts? Or will the horrors of Shanghai become another bizarre aberration to be memory-holed with a million other misdeeds?",

That era is hopefully coming to a close as China’s appetite moves into the bigger ticket, more complicated items of aircraft, cars, semiconductors and others. They’re going to try and steal it all. And Germany is still operating on this 1990’s early 2000’s mentality where China was a bastion, heading towards democratic reforms. They need to wake up and smell the strong coffee and see the two headed snake for what it really is. China is a staunch rival and seeking to monitor the world under their style of governance. I think they’ll eventually collapse from within before that ever happens. And their style wouldn’t even come close to flying in truly liberal societies.\n\nEdit: people have seen the game they’re playing.

Yes, China built large dams, but also Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. \n\nFurthermore, the idea that dams lead to droughts is false. Large dams might cause some reduction when they are filling up, but in the long run, they contribute to regulating water flows and mitigating the hazards of droughts and flooding (as they are designed to do). The largest impacts that dams have is on sediments and aquatic ecosystems, not water quantity. \n\nChina definitely needs to be transparent and cooperative in managing the Mekong River, though.\n\nPS: There have been multiple reports about the impacts of dams on Mekong river. Most have mentioned the undeniable effects of dams on silt and sediments, as well as on livelihoods of farming and fishery communities downstream. However, still little evidence is supporting the notion on the impacts of dams on water discharge. There are some reports from Eyes on Earth indicating that, but there are also counterargument. You can read this report from MRC about the 2018-2019 droughts (which also cites other reports from Eyes on Earth and Tsinghua Uni.)\nhttps://www.mrcmekong.org/assets/Publications/Mekong-low-flow-and-drought-conditions-2019-2021df.pdf",

After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions, the officials said.  \n  \nIt's really not a good look. I know that it's far from the only time when this might be appropriate to say, but it really feels like China is on the wrong side of history on this. It's one thing to generally side with a close ally (i.e. for China to support Russia's narrative), but it's another thing entirely to gaslight and propagate a patently false narrative which ultimately worsens international relations.  \n  \nWe increasingly hear about China as major world power, but time and time again they shirk the responsibilities thereof and take the low road. If they had collaborated with the US to defuse tensions in the lead up to this war, it would've been a major geopolitical win for China--proof, you could say, of their ability to take on a real leadership role in world affairs.",

Absent a coordinated effort from everyone who posts about Tianenmen Square to boycott TikTok, a 100x difference is far too large to occur naturally.

US allied APAC nations Japan South Korea and ASEAN nations ought be so afraid right now.\n\nUkraine Russia is going in favor of Russia which China have stood by with strong partnership, and is a major commodities supplier to China. Israel-Palestine is going in favour of whoever is not on Israel side, global discussions are overwhelmingly pro-Palestine, hatred for Israel and Jews are at extreme highs, Israel is trapped, if they dont win the war against Hamas, they lose ground, they lose lives, they lose dignity. If they win the war against Hamas, the international world guided by China, Muslim countries will banish Israel, drag their relations with Israel to the gutters. And China wins support of the Global South in Muslim countries - Middle East, ASEAN while US sees itself increasingly unwelcomed in the Global South and suffer the similar hatred for Jews due to its support for Israel. And with China increasingly stirring such flames, US will find itself having no grounds left in those countries. \n\nUS election is also going in favor of China, elect Trump, you get pro-Israel, pro-Russia (US lose in reputation and global South standing for supporting Israel, Russia negotiations and land grab will go heavily in favor of Russia and US and NATO effectively just showed that they are weak, and the truce will allow Russia to rebuild its military once again). Elect Democrats, you get anti-Israel, anti-Russia, government remains weak, military fails to continue its development, resources remain overstretched, focused on woke ideologies, allowing pro-Palestine groups and internal strife to wreck chaos in US internally. Again, regardless of whatever the outcome is, China wins so so so hard. \n\nYou might think but China is doing economically and socially badly. BUT does it really matter? They have complete surveillance and extreme control over most of its population. Societal control includes confiscation of passports for state workers, rate limiting passport applications for overseas travel, extreme surveillance, propaganda and lots of people in China who support the CCP, People's police specifically trained to tackle social revolts, riots, with signals cancelling vans to prevent live telecomms transmission, cloth blockade to hide any protests message. Many Chinese may suffer but it doesn't impact CCP's plans to replace America's hegemony in the world. In the same way, China GDP grew under Mao, industrialized but most Chinese suffered. But in the end, it doesn't matter, Mao is willing to throw millions of lives away to achieve its geopolitical goals and agenda and his own ego. \n\nI dont think US, Europe and the Western allied nations understand how bad or fked up of a shape they are in right now. They are getting outplayed by China Russia and others in the very same principles that made them strong because they don't have to obey those rules because they dont give a shit about standing on moral high grounds"

                "China has repeatedly called for peace talks in Ukraine. What it has not done is press Russia to negotiate an end to a war that has already cost thousands of lives, displaced millions and threatened to disrupt the world’s economy and even food security.\n\nDespite calls from other world leaders to play a more proactive role, China has instead tried to keep its distance. It has urged peace but not stepped up to mediate or organize talks, leaving such efforts to far smaller powers, including France, Turkey and Israel.\n\nIntervening more forcefully, in the view of officials in Beijing, is fraught with political and economic risks that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, appears reluctant to take. Instead it has sought to walk a careful line between the international outrage over Russia’s invasion and support for one of its most powerful partners.\n\nThe result has been to leave China, diplomatically, on the sidelines of the conflict, unable or unwilling to wield influence commensurate with its growing economic and military might.\n\n“If Xi truly wants the crisis to end,” John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, said, “then the flat-footed response testifies to China’s impotence in world politics, despite decades of rising to great power status.”\n\nOfficials in Beijing say they do want to see the carnage stop. In a video conference call with President Biden last Friday, Mr. Xi endorsed a two-part approach — a cease-fire, followed by humanitarian aid, according to Chinese officials.\n\nIt is not clear, however, whether Mr. Xi has communicated that to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. They spoke the day after the war began on Feb. 24 but not since. Mr. Xi has yet to speak with Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAs the fighting has dragged on, and with it the toll in human suffering, China’s diplomats have been forced into increasingly contorted defenses of Beijing’s stance.\n\nThey have touted humanitarian aid to Ukraine but refused to criticize Mr. Putin’s government for causing the humanitarian crisis. China’s ambassador to Ukraine, Fan Xianrong, told officials in Lviv that China was “a force of good” for the country and praised the Ukrainian unity in the face of a war that officials in Beijing will not describe as an invasion.\n\nChina’s avoidance of any criticism of Russia undermines its claim to be a neutral party.\n\n“Don’t be naïve,” China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday when pressed to explain why China refused to criticize Russia’s invasion. “Condemnation doesn’t solve the problem.”\n\nChina’s stance has already hardened views toward it in Europe, which has shown remarkable unity against the Russian invasion ahead of a planned summit between the European Union and China on April 1. It has also prompted warnings from the United States that explicit economic or military assistance to Russia would prompt harsh punishment against China.\n\nChina’s policy is bound by the deep, even personal relationship Mr. Xi has forged with the Russian leader. The war has strained but so far not broken those bonds.\n\nChinese officials also share Mr. Putin’s view of the United States, accusing it of fanning the flames that ignited the war by expanding NATO. They have also criticized the American use of economic and trade sanctions to punish Russia.\n\nIn the zero-sum calculation that drives policymaking, pressing Russia to make concessions would effectively bolster the position of the United States and its allies. At the same time, China cannot afford to sever its ties with them, either.\n\n“China does not have any other partner of the same strategic weight as Russia, who shares his distrust of the current international order,” said Bilahari Kausikan, Singapore’s former ambassador to Russia and the United Nations. “And that’s the bottom line. They won’t do anything that would fundamentally jeopardize the relationship with Russia or undermine Putin’s grip on power.”\nEditors’ Picks\n‘OK, Doomer’ and the Climate Advocates Who Say It’s Not Too Late\nThe Rise of the Tucker Carlson Politician\n‘Harry Potter for Adults’: Netflix Lures ‘Bridgerton’ Fans With Live Events\n\nIn Washington, officials view Mr. Xi’s position as duplicitous, comparing it to China’s handling of the diplomacy around North Korea’s nuclear program. In that case, it has called for the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions, while still providing it with energy and other products to blunt the impact of United Nations sanctions.\n\nIn some respects, the talks over North Korea’s nuclear program were a high-water mark for China’s international diplomacy. It played host to several rounds of negotiations that reached a landmark agreement in 2005 for North Korea to forsake its weapons in exchange for economic aid and security assurances. A year later the deal fell apart and the country’s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, conducted a nuclear test.\n\nSince then, China’s role in international diplomacy has remained limited.\n\nOn the United Nations Security Council, where China is one of the five permanent, veto-wielding powers, it has often played more of a supporting role than a leading one. In many cases that means joining Russia. When the war began, however, China was one of three of the 15 members that abstained from a resolution that condemned the invasion. (Russia vetoed it.) That raised some expectations that a crack might open between the two countries, but since then China has continued to provide diplomatic cover for Russia.\n\nLast week, Xue Hanqin, China’s judge on the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ top judicial body, joined a Russian judge in dissenting from a ruling last week calling for Russia to halt its military campaign in Ukraine.\n\nIn her dissent, Judge Xue wrote that a provisional ruling on Ukraine’s claim of a genocide unfolding would “not contribute to the resolution of the crisis in Ukraine.”\n\nIn other international forums, too, China has gone so far as to discourage multilateral peace efforts, dismissing an appeal by Ukraine to bring up the war for debate in the ministerial meetings of the Group of 20 major economies, being held this year in Indonesia.\n\n“The G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, not an appropriate platform to discuss political security issues such as Ukraine,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhao Lijian, said. The organization, he added, “should stick to its mandate.”\n\nChina may find its position increasingly untenable as the human and economic toll rises in Ukraine, and beyond. The European Union’s chief diplomat has called on China to do more. So did the foreign minister of Singapore, which has maintained friendly relations with Beijing.\n\n“I think the first thing is that China has enormous influence on Russia, both politically, economically and diplomatically,” the minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said in a forum organized by Bloomberg News.\n\nEven in China, there are voices urging the Chinese government to do more, arguing that bolder efforts should be expected of a country that aspires to global leadership.\n\n“We need to really get everybody together,” said Wang Huiyao, the president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing who has called for China to mediate and give Mr. Putin an off-ramp. “That’s where something is missing right now.”\n\nOthers, though, see the war as an opportunity for China, if handled carefully.\n\nAt a recent meeting of Chinese foreign policy and security scholars in Beijing to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, at least some concluded that there was “no urgency in bringing about an end to the war,” according to a summary of their discussion that was posted on a Chinese website. China also lacked experience in leading global negotiations, some of the scholars argued at the meeting organized by MacroChina, an economic research group based in Beijing. (The summary was later removed.)\n\n“The war is sapping the national strength of the old powers of the United States, Europe and Russia,” the summary described the scholars as saying. “China needs to watch the fire from the opposite bank and stay out of the war.”",

            "text": "As many of you already know, China has been regurgitating and amplifying Kremlin's disinformation and narratives since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Right now the biggest disinformation being pushed all over the Chinese internet is the whole \"American biolab in Ukraine and COVID origins\" narrative that originated from Russia. As always China doesn't just regurgitate it, it also adds many elements of it's very own deranged narratives and disinformation. There have been an endless stream of trending videos and articles on all the popular social media sites, uploaded by channels ranging from the biggest state media (People's daily) to the hundreds of different so called \"independent/ self media (自媒体)\" uploaders. \n\nThese propaganda dominate the frontpages and popular searches, but unlike many years ago this time there is a scary absence of any questioning or counter arguments. Even during the early days of the COVID outbreak back in 2020 there were noticeable resistance and questioning regarding the disinformation and propaganda being pushed at the time. The past few years have been brutal when it comes to the crackdown of what little freedom of speech and voices of critical thinking there were left in China, and I'm afraid that China has once again entered a time where there is no room for even the slightest of differing opinion.\n\nAs I have done in my previous post I highly recommend that people visit the links of these propaganda videos below, auto translate the entire webpages and read through the comments underneath. These are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis frontpage trending Bilibili video does an in depth analysis on the origins of the \"American biolabs in Ukraine\" and their \"connections to secret biological weapon experiments\", and of course the \"connections to the COVID outbreak\". The video essay cites many so called \"credible Western and Russian sources\" and presents many \"evidences\". Most of these evidences are just Kremlin's \"trust me bro\" or taking some Western sources very out of context and spin it in favor of the narrative: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ET4y1i7et](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ET4y1i7et)\n\nThis video is from China's biggest state media channel the People's Daily, and in it the Chinese state spokesman regurgitates Kremlin's disinformation: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FP4y1u7Ap/?spm\\_id\\_from=333.788.recommend\\_more\\_video.-1](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FP4y1u7Ap/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.-1)\n\nA different popular video sharing platform but the same trending searches, just like all the popular social media in China right now: [https://www.ixigua.com/search/%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%8C%96%E6%AD%A6%E5%99%A8/?logTag=594535e3690f17a88cdb&tab\\_name=search](https://www.ixigua.com/search/%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%8C%96%E6%AD%A6%E5%99%A8/?logTag=594535e3690f17a88cdb&tab_name=search)\n\nAn interesting side note is that China has not really uploaded these videos externally onto YouTube like they have done before, instead they're being a lot more covert and low key when spreading disinformation on the wider internet. My guess is that they have seen how the Russian state channels and accounts have been censored and blocked recently, and so China is being a lot more careful. Nonetheless, it's very important that we keep an eye on the situation inside China because it's completely different to how Chinese diplomats display themselves outwards. There is also a concerning lack of attention by the Western media on what's going on in China. If there are other Chinese speakers on here, please link and expose as much info from within China as possible, the world needs to be alert.",

Not to mention amphibious operations on a such a tiny island would also be a nightmare.\n\nTaiwan has the backing of the US and local western block allies, which by extension means NATO will also get soft pulled into it. China does not want to deal with that, and desperately needs western markets to fuel their export economy, therefore it wants to avoid embargoes at all costs.\n\nThere is no political will from Beijing to actually do it. The country is on its knees, facing big socioeconomic challenges that will decide the next couple of decades and there’s simply way too much else to worry about. The invasion of Taiwan is something they mention reaffirm their authority and the legitimacy of their government but it would be an operational nightmare.\n\nAll this being said, I was wrong about Putin not invading Ukraine, but I like to think I understand this situation much better\n\nEdit: to be clear, I didn’t think Putin would invade until the buildup in late 2021 not when he actually invaded",

Anyone who’s had baijiu dinners with Chinese in laws will have heard all the lectures. Seen how otherwise rational people can be so narrow minded and focussed. If you e met military types, you know it’s that x 100.\n\nThere are also reasons that the window may be closing - as China ages, young people aren’t interested in settling political grudges from the 1950s in torrents of blood.\n\nMany informed Russia watchers said ‘no way Putin will go for Ukraine’.

It is also pulling a lot of the money from Europe and looks like it is financially setting up to avoid any sanctions that may come from an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nTalk it's cheap.

But there are big factors like:\n\n1. Does China have competent commanders? Because as you see, Russia does not and if Chinese general ranks are given to anyone that heavily supports CCP- doesn't really contribute anything.\n2. China doesn't have that much modern war experience, Experience plays a big factor.\n3. I do not know how heavily are the military trainings ,perhaps we have Chinese soldiers that were in the military and can share their experience.\n4. Big army, requires big logistic setting. It's also a question, can Chinese army arm all of their soldiers.\n5. I do not see how China could be invaded by anyone, only if China would invade someone. And for China to invade someone, they would most likely face guerilla warfare (similar to Ukraine vs Russia)- it also a question, can China deal with Guerillas.\n\nRegarding who's better or worse, it really depends. Everybody thought that Russians are elite, but the truth is sad. And we didn't see Chinese go to war.

This is not the Korea war anymore where numerical superiority can still overcome technological shortcomings. Even against Vietnam back in 1979, China did poorly initially against battle hardened Vietnamese troops. Eventually China did get the upper hand through attrition and numbers but I doubt this can be repeated on a modern battlefield against say NATO.",
                "The miltary response is one thing but the bigger picture for China is the global response to the invasion. The Freezing of Russian financial reserves is going to push Russia into ta debt default which will wreck the Russian economy for decades.\n\nEven if China can somehow prepare or deal with something like that, its not so much what the US and the West have done in response but their willingness to act that Xi will be worrying about now. Putin was gambling that the US wouldn't be willing to risk a strong response to his actions, and he was critically wrong and Russia is going to pay dearly for that.\n\n\nIf the US blockade the South China Sea, which is completely feasible for them to do, China would collapse in a matter of months. China's completely dependent on imports to fuel its economy. A couple of months without coal imports and the lights go out."

            "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/wim0wq/are_taiwan_and_ukraine_really_that_comparable/",
            "text": "I'm still of the belief that the CCP won't do anything stupid and attack Taiwan, which would possibly be political or even literal suicide for Xi and his cronies. Plenty of people, however, would say that we thought the same way with Russia/Ukraine, yet Putin attacked anyways. However, how comparable are these 2 situations we see here?\n\nIMO, there is far more holding back China attacking Taiwan than Russia attacking Ukraine. The US has never committed to defend Ukraine militarily, so the threat of US intervention on Ukraine's side is almost non-existent.\n\nTaiwan is far more important to America's national interests than Ukraine ever was. For one, Taiwan is part of the first island chain, and if China were to seize it, it would give their navy access to the open Pacific. This would be a direct challenge to US naval dominance in the Pacific, and something that the US would never accept at all costs. The other reason is that Taiwan produces the majority of the world's semiconductors, and the US for obvious reasons cannot let China occupy or destroy the majority of the world's semi conductor production.\n\nThe US has also been committed to defend Taiwan ever since 1950. To abandon a long time ally of over 7 decades would be an enormous loss of face for the US, and absolutely cripple American influence around the world. Ukraine, by contrast, only existed for 30 years, and US/Ukraine relationship was nowhere near as close at any point. That is why the US can afford to stay out of Ukraine militarily.\n\nThe idea that China would risk war with it's largest trading partner and the most powerful military on Earth seems absolutely insane to me.  It would completely decimate their economy and military and weaken the CCP's grip on their own people. The only way I can see war happening is if China's economy is already in the dumpster, and the CCP attacks Taiwan as a last-ditch rally around the flag effect.\n\nRussia never had to risk war with the US to invade Ukraine, which is why Putin attacked.",

                "There may be more holding China back from attacking Taiwan, but the PRC's claim to Taiwan is much stronger than Russia's on Ukraine (both legally, given that Ukraine is acknowledged to be independent by Russia, and politically, given that not all Russians believe the core piece of turning around a century of humiliation is Ukraine). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTaiwan certainly is far more in American national interests, both given that it is a democracy with very strong political ties between the nations, and that its economy is critical to the west. So I'm very confident the US and its allies would come to Taiwan's aid. But I'm also quite confident the long term survival of the CCP is dependent on being able to reclaim Taiwan. If Taiwan became independent, I doubt the CCP would be able to maintain its legitimacy, and a more extreme group (or faction within the CCP) would take hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChina put itself between a rock and a hard place once they identified reunification as the #1 political issue in recent decades, so much so that I think the only way to avoid war would be for the PRC to pursue a more humanitarian approach and revitalize the One China Two Systems framework (I'm also 99% sure this won't happen). Russia had much more freedom of actions until the invasion itself.",

Do you think the Treaty of San Francisco gives Taiwan's sovereignty back to China? Yes: NEXT; No: GO TO 4.\n3. Which is the ONLY legitimate government of China, PRC or ROC? PRC: you are pro-reunification, END; ROC: you may be one of Pan-Blue Coalition, END.\n4. Do you think Taiwan has the right to self-determine its sovereignty or independence? YES: you are pro-independence and maybe Pan-Green Coalition. No: you need to see a doctor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTaiwan is geopolitically important, that's true. But legally speaking, US' commitment to Taiwan on defense is very ambiguous. I personally don't think US will directly intervene with the invasion and send troops to Taiwan to help its defense. That's dangerous and cost-ineffective.\n\nBesides, TSMC is important but not US' lifeline. US will subsidizing TSMC's effort to transfer its factory, especially the most-advanced ones to United States which is why China tries hard to lobby US Congress for not passing the bill. And, Intel and Samsung still have the capability of manufacturing outside Taiwan and they have many US shareholders. If TSMC's capability of manufacturing gets destroyed, Samsung and Intel will profit heavily from the chip shortage."

                "Germany and Italy have shown a willingness to hurt their own interests by cancelling Nordstream 2 and agreeing to disconnect Russia from Swift. \n\nI think by and large, most people in Europe will be willing to put up with the sacrifice of increased prices due to energy shortage. We are likely in for hard times ahead, but I think sentiment is overwhelmingly pro-Ukraine and shock that Putin was crazy enough to really do it. We thought this had been consigned to the history books. It strikes hard against the core of European values and sense of history so people will be willing to make sacrifices.\n\nThis is something that the CCP will note. My impression is, the Chinese governing elite believe very strongly that people will always put material interests first and foremost. I hope this provides an opportunity to show them that is not the case.\n\nAdditionally, Hungary, formerly quite pro-Russia, has taken a stand against them which ruins quite a lot of years of Russian geopolitical efforts. If Ukraine can beat back the invasion, they will likely get fast tracked to EU membership and NATO, diminishing Russia's position significantly. Finland and Sweden may also join NATO as a result once Russia is defeated. It will likely strengthen the EU, and could even result in the creation of an EU Army, which has been discussed for a while. It could also result in the UK's return to the EU. A response of that nature will show the Chinese that a failure to take Taiwan could result in their countries isolation, the rapid disintegration of \"friendships\" with countries like Cambodia and Pakistan, and the emergence of a formidable anti-China military alliance in Asia (think Asian NATO).\n\nThe UK is cracking down on Russian assets and Abramovich has fled, abandoning his ownership of Chelsea FC. Chinese officials and elites with assets and family homes in the west will be taking note.\n\nHowever, I think a greater lesson will be from Ukraine's resistance. It appears that Putin believed Ukrainians are Russian, their government is an illegitimate puppet state, and the Russian army will be welcomed as liberators, but in fact, this is far from the reality and it appears that Ukraine is putting up a solid fight and may even defeat the invasion.\n\nThis is very similar to how China views Taiwan, and the spectre of unexpectedly fierce Taiwanese resistance and a humiliating Chinese defeat will make them think twice.\n\nIn short - it is very important for Taiwan that Ukraine can defend itself, that Europe can show it will make sacrifices for Ukraine, that Russia's place on the world stage diminishes, and that alliances to counter Russia are strengthened.\n\nIf this happens, Taiwan will be safe for the foreseeable future. If not, Taiwan may be finished by 2030.",
                "The CCP are unable to invade Taiwan and would have done so decades ago if they could. The situation isn't comparable whatsoever. The only chance they have imo is to somehow manage to rig the elections and put some CCP puppet in charge",
                "Invasion of Taiwan would be so much difficult because you can't just roll tanks into Taiwan. Russia pretty much is having trouble capturing Kyiv airfields and maintaining occupation. Taiwan pretty much need to defend the couple beaches that are suitable for amphibious landings and airfields to prevent China from successfully landing. Then it's just a game of stalling China like how Ukraine is doing with Russia.\n\nThe difference between Taiwan and Ukraine is one is a powerhouse for manufacturing 21st oil (microchips) and the other isn't. When global supply of microchips collapses during Chinese invasion of Taiwan, other countries are gonna get pissed off.",
                "It’s hard to see how the PLA, which has almost no serious combat experience, could pull off one of the hardest military strategies - amphibious landing - against a military specifically designed to stop that.",
                "The best answer is we don't know, and it is anybody's guess.  it is very difficult to separate bluster and how the people in charge actually think this way. \n\nThe assumption is the PRC is definitely looking at it closely. It's tricky for China because they can believe the US might act in two totally different ways based on what is happening in Ukraine.\n\n* They see US weakness for not intervening in Ukraine\n* They see US strategic discipline for not getting involved, instead of focusing their attention on China.\n\nMost young Chinese nationalists would take assume the first would be happening.\n\nHowever, the most important takeaway isn't the Western response, but how the Ukrainians defend themselves.  Even if the Ukrainian cities get taken in 3 weeks, if an insurgency manifest itself killing hundreds of Russians every week, China would think twice.\n\nChina has advantages the Russians don't have with regards to Taiwan, but they also have a lot of disadvantages. The second factor is even if Ukrainians fail it's how badly they fail.  If they end up killing 10,000 Russians, Taiwan is safe.\n\nXi Jinping is much more cautious than Putin, and would only launch an invasion if success is almost guaranteed. And what I mean by success, is it's a clean surgical operation, because that is what they have been telling the Chinese people. If they tell it's going to cost 100,000 PLA dead then that is a different story."

            "text": "My recent studies have exposed me to the rapidly growing and, apparently, very close Sino-Russian relationship. The governmental relationship has grown a lot since Russia's first invasion of Ukraine, and took another huge jump with the announcement of the \"no limits\" partnership just prior to the second Russian invasion.\n\nXi and Putin, in particular, have been going out of their way to make the relationship seem incredibly deep, so much so that words like a pseudo-alliance are used often. \n\nMy question is, what does the young Chinese population think of this? As their government increases its ties with Russia and distances itself further from the West, what does this mean for your future? Is it seen as a net positive to help Russia fight its war? Does the financial benefits of the cheap oil and Russia's purchasing manufactured goods and equipment seen as a great deal, or something else? In general, are you happy to be functionally allied with Russia?\n\nAs an American, I find it fascinating considering the history of China and Russia/the Soviet Union. There are some in the States that are frustrated by our government's close ties with Saudi Arabia or even Israel, who seem to hold values that do not match our own. We also have dark periods in our past where our government supported dictators simply because they would keep the \"existential\" threat of Communism at bay. Do either of those apply here?",

                "There are four basic views of Russia in China.\n\n1. Russia is China's ally in fighting the west, so we should support them. If you don't support Russia, then you support the west, which means you're an enemy of the state or is brainwashed by western propoganda. Russia's war against Ukraine is justified because Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union so this is really just a unification war. Zelensky is a puppet of the west and a Nazi that should be defeated.\n\n2. Russia has betrayed its glorious tradition of communism and get corrupted into capitalism, but I hate the west even more so I support Russia.\n\n3. Russia is China's ally in suppressing freedom and democracy. The Chinese government align with them but the people should hope for a Russian defeat.\n\n4. Russia is China's rival. They robbed a lot of land from us (you can google the Qing map), threatened to use nuclear missles on China, and now they're supporting India. Plus, Russia is losing the war and they suck. We should abandon this sunken boat before they turn on us.\n\n1 and 2 sometimes overlap, together they're about 70%; 3 and 4 are the rest 30%.",
                "Well, as a Chinese I’m pretty sad to tell you, Chinese people love Russia simply because Russia could help China to fight against America, providing the natural resources we need and military support.\n\nBut what is difference between two superpowers is that the Chinese government and the CCP controls most  the traditional media, post positive news about Russia on their official media(or propaganda media)and have a strict censorship toward self media, which made it overwhelmingly hard to post negative messages about Russia, and Putin on the internet. (As far as I know, even academic research about Russian politics and history is also frozen)Thus, most Chinese people, especially those who didn’t have the access to the information from the outside world, really believe that Russia is our unbreakable friend.",
                "It seems to be fairly positive. Many believe that Russia has been historically and presently treated unfairly by the West and needs a buddy. The government in China wants Chinese people to fight for the socialist cause and sees Russia as an ally in that sense given their communist history. I notice too that my university has switched to promoting Russian culture and language a lot more than English, French, German, Korean, Japanese etc. Every week they have Russian cultural activities but none for the other majors.",
                "Supporting Russia is a way to disgust the United States, just like Louis XVI supported the United States to disgust Britain. Many people expect that Russia will sell land to support its war in the future so that China can take back Vladivostok.",
                "It's overwhelmingly positive. \n\nAbsolute miracle of Russian psyops. \n\nThere's no awareness that Russia has historically been the biggest aggressor towards China, nor any awareness that modern Russians are intensely racist against the Chinese. Information on either is heavily censored in Chinese media. \n\nIt's a running joke on the Chinese subs.\n\nEdit to add, looks like a lot of Russian apologists crawling out of their caves.

However the real people's minds will be significantly influenced (now I even will say 'manipulated') by it.\n\nObviously this propaganda machine has helped Trump's victory very much.\n\nWhat scared me even more is that, I think the only way to defeat this kind of national propaganda machine of a country with 1.3 billion brain washed people as their 'human resource', is the national countermeasure of a big democratic country like US's NSA, CIA, and FBI, etc., However, Trump will of course sabotage this.\n\nThe international deep state = China + Elon Musk + Trump + Russia, will inflict the threat that could really destroy the democracy of US, for the first time.\n\n\\------update 01 -------\n\nNow trump is nominating **Tulsi as the Director of the National Intelligence.** thing is really becoming worse.\n\n\\-------update 02 -------\n\none very important proof of The international deep state = China + Elon Musk + Trump + Russia,\n\nis that for at least one year, maybe even more time, **the exact same lies are being massively spread in China, as that in YouTube, at the same time.** I have experienced this for many times. considering that the Chinese Internet is separated from the world Internet by the GFW, and GFW and all the Chinese media (official media and the social media, including the 'individual' influencers) have been totally controlled by CCP, this is a clear proof that CCP has joined the spreading of the lies all over the world. CCP is part of the international deep state which I mentioned above.\n\n\\------- update 03 --------\n\nI heard that **Trump is planning to cancel the 'CHIPS and Science Act' ?**\n\nTrump is really the friend of CCP.\n\n  \n\\-------- update 04 -------\n\nanother proof of the Chinese propaganda machine is as follows, just negative attacking without any proof.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUjkLA8cbBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUjkLA8cbBk)",

The real twist is to note whether or not Xi will ultimately come to save Putin at the 11th hour because Xi **knows** that if Putin goes down, China will be utterly isolated in the world and his own survival will be threatened. Question is what price will China pay for doing that and will it be worth it?",

But if you look at MSCI China tech index... the numbers are stark and reveal that you would've averaged something like 1% growth rate since its inception. For perspective, BABA stock price is barely above its 2014 IPO price, Tencent and JD are 50% and 30% down respectively from this time last year and Huawei is... well, Huawei. Let's not even delve into the education sector which accumulated is forecast to send an unemployment wave of 10 million people back out. \n\nThe real estate sector is in all kinds of mess and it's fairly obvious that the contagion is already spreading to other developers. Greenland, a *state owned* enterprise last week had to receive a $350m bond raise from **other** SOE's for liquidity purposes which is in effect a targeted bailout against a debt load of $190 billion and $3.7 billion due this year. It's not just the private companies like Evergrande that are teetering anymore. \n\nThen you have supply shocks galore across the board and shortage spikes of basic commodities like energy and food all the while against the backdrop of COVID cases spiking domestically which is likely to have further impact on growth and the previously highly ambitious target of 5.5% GDP growth set by Li Keying scant weeks ago just looks like a fanciful fairy tale today. Statistics show that approximately 200 million Chinese are in 'flexible employment' situations and this is just not a sustainable number. \n\nAll the while, the foreign environment is raging with a war in Ukraine that China is clearly on the wrong side of history on despite what Wang Yi says. \n\nI genuinely challenge anyone, even the most fervent wumao, to point out where the bright spots and saving graces are for China's outlook are.",

Neither Russia or Ukraine or Europe has anything to do with China per say, hence China is not expected to interfere in others' domestic matter, a very vocal and long held practice. \n\nDuring the 1950s, as the North Koreans were retreating and US forces continued pushing North, crossed the 38th parallel line, the Chinese government intervened and sent their troops to cross the Yalu river.

There's a moderate probability of a slow win for Ukraine and smaller probability of a slow win from Russia. Either way, it's not efficient from a geopolitical or humanitarian angle, and distracts from science and economic growth, which will directly affect the wellness of all leaders over the next 20 years.\n\nMost countries have put their cards in. Not China (yet).\n\nChina has credible weight to enforce the return of Russian soldiers to Russia (via its proximity to Russia, existing trade links and the fact that Russia has few credible partners). China and Russia have discussed and made concrete steps towards an \"unlimited partnership\" in the last several years, but it's not clear that a bipartite alliance with a confused and isolated decision-making structure more intent on chaos than anything else can surpass warm relations with the more modern US + Europe + Indian economy. In isolated economies, it's useful to make rivals fight each other, however, that's less clear when you're dealing with interconnected supply chains and unstable credit structures yourself.\n\nChina's greatness beckons.\n\n**A 3-party deal:**\n\n1. China gets favorable trade concessions, possibly on microchips, which it needs in the long run more than cheap oil (this can be supplied from many places). It also gets to look like a responsible leader of the future, which can affect its standing in other trade deals.\n2. Russia is forced to accept an end to the war on less than perfect terms, however, as an isolated power w/ trade dependencies on other, it has no choice but to continue to do business with either China or the West. Blaming Chinese leverage in some ways gives Russia an out to avoid the painful face lost by “being defeated by Ukraine/the West on the battlefield.\"\n3. Ukraine gets its territory back, backed up by this geopolitical calculus to hold it.\n\nThoughts? What would India feel?",

            "comments": [
                "Ukraine was a Russian ally/client state, not an American or even EU one. Russia had pre-deployed a decisive number of troops in Crimea. The Euromaidan protests, were, as the name suggests, a pro-EU as opposed to a pro-US movement. And when Russia invaded and conquered Crimea it did so using the troops already in Crimea. Crimea is in an area internal sea far away from any US or NATO bases. Crimea is also strategically important to Russia but not really to the US.\n\nUkraine became a US ally after the Crimean invasion, not before. And the US has been very aggressive in helping the Ukrainians shrink the amount of land lost to the Russians. Overall the real narrative is “the Russians are terrible allies that will stab you in the back and steal your land” while the US will come when called even if you’re not a US ally. The US has gained a strategic position in Eastern Europe by having Ukraine now irrevocably anti-Russia/pro-US due to Crimea versus its status as a Russian client state ore-war.\n\nTaiwan is none of these things. There are no Chinese troops on Taiwan, it is already a US ally. Taiwan is hugely strategically valuable due to its oversized role it plays in semiconductors, geographic position in the first island Chain, and symbolically as the “canary in the coal mine” for US power in the Pacific. It is very close to US based in the Philippines, Okinawa, and mainland Japan, and the Japanese have been fortifying their small islands around Taiwan with A2/AD equipped garrisons. Finally, an invasion of Taiwan would require Chinese assets to be concentrated in a known, stationary area. \n\nThe US and the advanced economies are not going to let China waltz in and take Taiwan’s semiconductor foundries and be at the mercy of Chinese diplomacy for their electronics industries. Taiwan isn’t going to roll over and surrender in hope that they’ll get a one country two systems deal after what happened to Hong Kong. And the US pacific fleet isn’t going to let a very legitimate casus belli go to waste while all the modernized PLA assets are concentrated in one place. A2/AD is much easier and cheaper to pull of than anti-A2/AD and it would be the end of US power in the Pacific if they did nothing.",
                "I can think of a few reasons. First, Taiwan's pedigree as a legitimate regime, committed to liberal democracy under the rule of law, has given it a pretty sterling reputation since the 1980s. So this isn't a case where it's just one authoritarian regime against another. Ukraine, well... they've had huge problems with corruption, and while they're better than Russia with respect to civil liberties and the rule of law, they still have a very long way to go.\n\nSecond, Russia is a first-rate nuclear power. This means that the US and Russia have to be very, very careful with each other, because of the MAD doctrine. They have to move heaven and earth to avoid any direct conflict that could escalate to full out war. China, too, is a nuclear power, but their nuclear capabilities are easily outclassed by the US. They'd be able to do some serious damage: maybe take out Guam, Honolulu, Seattle. But if that happened, basically the entire Mainland would be turned into a giant radioactive parking lot. So if there was any conflict with China, the Chinese would be very desperate to avoid it becoming nuclear, because there's zero chance they'd survive, whereas the US would almost certainly survive, albeit wounded. So, in the event of a real military conflict, the US would not have to seriously worry about the conflict going nuclear.\n\nI'd also observe that the geography matters a lot here too. Since Taiwan is an island (or a series of islands, to be more precise), protecting Taiwan merely means denying the PLA Navy or Air Force the ability to project force over the island. That's not too hard to do, logistically speaking. Whereas with Ukraine, because it shares a land border with Russia, it's a lot harder to defend. Russia can easily flood Ukraine with guerillas and regular armed forces, particularly through the Donbass, which the Russians basically already control in all but name, or through Crimea, which they do control officially.\n\nAlso, it probably matters that while Taiwan is a major contributor to the world economy, Ukraine really isn't. You really don't want Taiwan's chip-building capabilities to fall into the hands of the CCP. Capturing Taiwan would be a major strategic coup for the Mainland in terms of the vastly expanded range with which it could project force within that region. Whereas Ukraine... well, we certainly wouldn't want that to happen, but since Ukraine's neighbors are mostly NATO members, Russia is unlikely to attempt any projection of force beyond Ukraine. By the terms of the NATO alliance treaty, if the Russians invaded the Baltics or Poland, that would trigger WWIII. So the Russians would be unlikely to be able to do much with the strategic advantage of holding Ukraine that they couldn't already do. Holding Kaliningrad, for example, gives them most of the advantages they'd want over Northern Europe, so capturing Ukraine wouldn't mean much of a geopolitical change from the status quo. Something to be avoided, surely, but full-out war to prevent Ukraine from falling into Russian hands would kind of defeat the purpose of preserving peace in the region.",
                "Tbh, I don't Really have an answer to this, Perhaps it is because China is now a major enemy to the U.S interests on Asia but Russia hasn't really been a threat to the US since the end of the Cold War, That is the best answer i can give.",
                "ITs for the following reasons\n\n1. The US-Taiwan ties go back over 110 years via US connections with the old KMT elite. Sun Yat Sen, Chiang Kai Shek and Chiang Ching Kuo were all baptist, a very American Christian denomination.  the American influence was very strong in Republican China, and its carried over into Taiwan when the KMT fled to Taiwan.  [Many Christian colleges and universities in Taiwan have their roots in Republican China, and were founded by American missionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_University).\n2. The Taiwan Relations Act. [This is a Act was passed by Congress in 1979 and serves as a basis for US-Taiwan relations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Relations_Act#:~:text=The%20act%20states%20that%20%22the,sufficient%20self%2Ddefense%20capabilities%22)\n3. Taiwan is a developed liberal democracy, the most liberal in East Asia. One of the primary goals of US after the Second World war is to protect democracy (not spread it).  It will be a huge blow to the US if Taiwanese end up in concentration camps like the Uighurs.\n4. Taiwan controls the semi-conductors and other key components for the tech industry.",

                "> BEIJING, March 7 (Reuters) - It is a \"naked double standard\" to seek to conflate the issues of Taiwan and Ukraine as the island has always been part of China and it is entirely a domestic matter, the Chinese foreign minister said on Monday.\n\n> China claims the democratically-governed island as its own territory and has over the past two years or so increased its military pressure against Taiwan, having never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control.\n\n> Both China and Taiwan's governments agree that Taiwan and Ukraine's situations are different, but for different reasons.\n\n> China says Taiwan has never been an independent country, while Taiwan says it is inappropriate to make a link as major chip-maker Taiwan is more important geopolitically, and that unlike Ukraine and Russia it shares no land border with China.\n\n> Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the Taiwan and Ukraine issues were \"not at all comparable\" as Taiwan was a domestic matter for China, while Ukraine was a dispute between two countries.\n\n> \"We have seen that some people emphasise the principle of sovereignty on the Ukraine issue, but continue to undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan issue. This is a naked double standard,\" he said, in apparent reference to the United States.\n\n> Washington is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, a frequent source of friction in Sino-U.S. ties.\n\n> China recognises no sovereignty claims by Taiwan's government, which in turn says the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island and only the Taiwanese people can choose their future.\n\n> Wang, speaking at his annual news conference on the sidelines of China's annual parliament meeting, said tensions were Taiwan's fault for the government's refusal to accept they were part of China, which will \"ruin Taiwan's future\".\n\n> He said hoped Taiwan's future lay in the peaceful development of relations across the strait that separates them.\n\n> \"In the end Taiwan will return to the embrace of the motherland.\"\n\nReporting by Ryan Woo; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Gareth Jones and Alex Richardson"

Taiwan somewhat falls into that category and it would be very difficult for China to be perceived as a credible or unbiased party by stakeholders in the negotiation. \n\nI mean hell, China had a hard enough time being taken seriously already before this whole fracas but meeting Putin a week ago in Beijing and declaring that their friendship has \"no limits\" definitely did not help the Chinese position.",

How do you expect them to twist Russia's arm? Aung Sang Suu Kyi was pro-Chinese before she was overthrown.

It is hard to know how the Putin regime can regain its legitimacy after this*. Putin had voiced his fears when he compared the situation to 1917, although 1905 may have been a better parallel. One way or the other, this is the payout stage of the gamble to invade Ukraine and this is the start of the end of the war. The Russian population and Putin’s elites had countenanced this war when it was far away—they will certainly think twice about doing so again after the conclusion of this farce.\n\nI loved this thoughtful analysis.  I hope he is right.",
                "Although the situation has deflated somewhat this most definitely gives Beijing pause regarding  the PLA, already an extremely powerful actor in China and the potential for a huge backlash should a Taiwan invasion cost dearly or outright fail. The CCP already massively distrust the army and has multiple safeguards in place to diminish the chance of a coup, for instance soldiers rarely serve in their home province, officers are frequently moved around between units and regions and top brass are paid off very handsomely in wages, perks and,,, eh, let's call it \"business opportunities\". \n\nThe fact that Russia came that close to an attempted coup/civil war in less than a day most definitely has the CCP shook to its core, especially considering the high unemployment rates, the slowing economy and that manufacturing is increasingly looking to places like India, Thailand or Vietnam for secondary production needs over China. The social contract between the people and the party is in large parts based on job security, economic progress, private enterprises opportunities and the procurement of basic needs and wants for everyone, like cars, housing and so on. Things like having a 25% unemployment rate for 18-25 year-olds work to undermine that unofficial contract.",

                "Sounds like the same position they had since 2014 and start of the current war, to date China has never officially recognized Crimea's independence/annexation because it would weaken their own position on Taiwan. Saying region/province in another country can break away unilaterally is same as supporting Taiwan unilateral independence. \n\nLast time the idiot chinese ambo in France got in trouble for suggesting the status of crimea might be up for interpretation with his statement on the legitamacy of post soviet states  and made the foriegn ministry make an official statement saying that was just his personal opinion and not the official state position.",
