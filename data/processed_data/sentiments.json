Trump trying to bully Ukraine into accepting some land lost...namely the lands Russia already has invaded and took control of.for the time being in the Donesk region.  That sounds eerily similar to the prime Minister who came before Winston Churchill, who came back with the \"Peace in our Time\" trendy slogan where the European nations basically signed over nearly all of Czechoslovakia and other areas taken control of by Hitler just prior to WW2 with the promise by Hitler that he wouldn't continue on his land grabs.  Turns out in history that Hitler didn't abide by his promise and he turned right around and just kept land grabbing by invasion.\n\n I see no reason why Putin wouldn't do the same thing other than the fact that Russia is getting their ass fucking handed to them by the Ukraine vis-a-vis donated NATO weapons.  While Ukraine forces are good, they were originally outmanned 64 to 1. \n\n Without the advanced weapon systems given to Ukraine by NATO, Russia would have boss hog smashed the Ukraine.  I am sure that pisses Putin off where he had dreams of the grand legacy of rebuilding the Soviet Empire. Yet, I think it's crazy to allow Russia any benefits here where they illegally invaded a sovereign democratic-values nation without cause or provocation simply because Ukraine voted in a leader that was not friendly to Putin or Russia.  Giving in and giving up the land grabs he has thus far would only serve to encourage other nations to do the same.  Such as China for instance who salivates waiting for a time to invade Taiwan.\n\nLet's be frank.... the situation is that we are a democratic nation as Ukraine is.  We're supposed to support our kindred spirits as such because we would want the same.  Taiwan and South Korea and Philippines and Japan are all watching closely how the USA handles this as it would be seen as representative of how we would support them in similar circumstances.  China is mindful that they too might be able to negotiate similarly by force invasion of Taiwan.  See, it is not so simple.  \n\nAs for the UK, bravo on the pledgr for troops, but supporting anything less than a full withdrawal by Russia is a sin and counter to both our nations' promise of liberty and opportunity in democratic ideals.  We would be hypocrits to back anything less than full withdrawal by Russia.  It is not okay to simply invade whoever you want when you want to get what you want.  \n\nThe Ukraine is completely against the proposed peace agreement and I don't blame them.  I think they should stand strong and stand firm. Russia should withdraw their forces back to their own border.  Humble pie though will be a nasty treat to eat for Russia though, but serves them right."}

Similarity can be drawn from the Cuban Missile Crisis. The longer answer is as follows.\n\nNATO was created strictly to counter the USSR. After the Soviet Union collapsed alongside the former Warsaw Pact, why did NATO not only continue to exist but grow in power to an unprecedented level? What did Russia do between 1991-2013 that was so egregious to European security interests?\n\nThe justification for NATO expansionism has been that Russia supposedly has aspirations for empire building.\nFor all the talk of Russian imperialism and that Putin wants to rebuild the Russian empire, all they've managed to do between 1991-2013 is quell an internal crisis in Chechnya and support separatists in Transnistria, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. That doesn't seem like serious empire building to me. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and starting supporting Donbass. More substantial actions, but not quite empire building. Now they've started a war in Ukraine, the most substantial move to date but not what I consider the beginning of building an empire, since they'll never be able to control the territory entirely.\n\nNATO needs Russia to be perceived as an enemy to validate it's existence.

I do not disseminate deliberately false information and do not betray my homeland. All I want is to speak up.  \n\nI am Russian, I am 21 y. o. and I am a student. When the problem with Ukraine started in 2013-2014, I was 13 y. o. I didn\u2019t watch the news, as I wasn\u2019t interested in it, and I didn\u2019t understand anything about politics.  \n\nA lot has changed over the years, and so have I. When the war began on February 24, to be honest, I was not even surprised. This does not mean that I SUPPORT the war. On the contrary, I believe that every life is sacred. But I always knew that despite humanism and pacifism, wars have always been, are and will be. And we all have one end - death, merely someone will die earlier, and someone later. And this is a reality.  \n\nThe first thing I did was to read the news and follow the situation. But when I went to social networks, where I follow some Ukrainian bloggers, I felt absolutely uncomfortable. I faced the strongest psychological pressure when a person told me through the screen that it was ME who was to blame for what had happened, ant it is MY fault that I, like all Russians, was allegedly apolitical. Many Russians succumbed to this and began to apologize. But I don\u2019t want to apologize. Because when I turned 18, I acquired the right to vote, which I have always used as intended. I am not apolitical, I am no longer 13 y. o. girl, and I did NOT make this decision.  \n\nDespite this unpleasant moment, I do not feel hatred for Ukrainians. I\u2019m sorry this war happened. I know that civilians are dying, I know everything. I have no relatives in Ukraine, but I have friends and acquaintances for whom I worry. I even know a Ukrainian soldier who is now fighting against my country, but we do not hate each other.  \n\nYesterday I decided to look into the origins of the current situation and began to read about the Euromaidan. I am one of those people who is looking for cause and effect relationships. And I found the following:  \n\n- during the Euromaidan, which was originally a protest action of civilians for Ukraine to join the European Union, diverse nationalist groups (UNA-UNSO, \u201cTrident\u201d, \u201cPatriot of Ukraine\u201d, etc.) formed the right-wing extremist association \u201cRight Sector\u201d, considering the Euromaidan only as a convenient pretext for starting a \u201cnational revolution\u201d, which, according to the leader of the \u201cRight Sector\u201d Dmytro Yarosh, was supposed to end with \u201cthe complete elimination of the regime of internal occupation and the creation of a Ukrainian national state with a system of all-encompassing national democracy\u201d;  \n\n- Representatives of the parliamentary opposition said that the government intends to establish an authoritarian dictatorship in Ukraine, and demanded the convocation of the People\u2019s Rada instead of the compromised Verkhovna Rada, the resignation of President Yanukovych and early presidential elections. In the following days, opposition-minded demonstrators in a number of regions of Ukraine proceeded to seize the buildings of regional state administrations. In western Ukraine, these actions were successful, while in the regions of central Ukraine, these attempts were suppressed by law enforcement agencies;  \n\n- On February 21, under pressure from Western countries, President Yanukovych made concessions and signed an agreement with the opposition to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, which included, in particular, an immediate return to the Constitution as amended in 2004, the formation of a government of national unity, holding early presidential elections no later than December 2014 year, non-use of violence and investigation of recent acts of violence. On the same day, Yanukovych left Kyiv;  \n\nI would like to note that very little is written in the foreign media about the role of radical right parties in this event.  \n\n- Right Sector\u2019s political ideology has been described as hardline right-wing nationalist, neo-fascist, or neo-Nazi, and right-wing, far-right or radical right. Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in Russian media during the first half of 2014, and Russian state TV depicted it as neo-Nazi because of its far-right, extremist views and anti-Russian sentiment; the Associated Press found no evidence that the group had committed hate crimes. According to the UN Human Rights Council, Right Sector is one of \u201cpotentially violent militias that acted seemingly on their own authority, thanks to a high level of official tolerance, and with almost complete impunity, both in the Donbass region and in wider Ukraine\u201d that \u201cuse violence or threats of violence to exert pressure on persons holding dissenting views, the judicial system and other mechanisms of accountability\u201d.  \n\n- The other main far-right party Right Sector won 1 seat (of the 450 seats in the Ukrainian parliament) in the same 2014 election.  \n\nMy question is: how can a radical right party, which even the Foreign media consider as neo-fascist one, be tolerant of other nations, and how can one say that the Russian media exaggerates everything? Meanwhile, the same foreign media are writing the following:  \n\n- In the wake of the 2014 Euromaidan, Eduard Dolinsky, executive director of the Kyiv-based Ukrainian Jewish Committee, expressed concern over the rise of antisemitism in Ukraine in an opinion for the New York Times, citing the social acceptance of previously marginal far- right groups and the government\u2019s policy of historical negationism with regard to antisemitic views of, and collaboration in the Holocaust by Ukrainian nationalists. Dolinsky also pointed out that Ukrainian Jews overwhelmingly supported and often participated in the Euromaidan protests.  \n\nHere are my favorite discoveries:  \n\n- American economist and political commentator Paul Roberts said that everything that happens in Ukraine was financed by the United States. He also noted: \u201cThis does not mean that the Ukrainians have no real justified claims. However, it is clear that all this is planned for Ukraine to join the EU and NATO in the future. Because the main goal of the United States is to locate its own military bases on its territory, next to the Russian border. On December 13, 2013, US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated during the Ukraine-USA Foundation conference that the United States has supported the building of democracy in Ukraine since its independence in 1991, and also called on the government, the president and the Ukrainian people to heed the voice of Euromaidan. The speech said that $5 billion had been spent on building democracy and other goals.  \n\n- US President Barack Obama on February 1, 2015, said in an interview with CNN that \u201cwe mediated the transition of power in Ukraine.\u201d  \n\nThis is not propaganda. These are confirmed official facts that can be found on the Internet with all the necessary links.  \n\nWhile I was looking for information in every language available to me, I noticed the following: foreign media are actively putting Russia in a bad position. Both in English and in Ukrainian Wikipedia they write that it was Russia that sponsored the Anti-Maidan movement. Perhaps this is true, I do not know. Meanwhile, the Russian Wikipedia writes, as you have already noticed, that the radical right movements and the Euromaidan were funded by the USA.  \n\nBased on these mutual accusations, we can draw the following conclusion: the war is not between Russia and Ukraine, but between Russia and the USA (aka NATO). And, as Paul Roberts pointed out, the problem is that US-led NATO is trying to contain Russia by building military bases in neighboring countries. Then it turns out that Russia really does not benefit from Ukraine\u2019s accession to the European Union, but also everyone knows that for the same reason Russia does not return the Kuril Islands to Japan.  \n\nBy encircling Russia, NATO will be able to rule my country. Perhaps we will be forced to sell oil, gas and other resources for next to nothing. They might force us to do something else. But if Russia will try to get out of this control, \u201cour temple will already have the barrel of a gun next to it.\u201d  \n\nI don\u2019t know if our government made the right decision by starting this war. I don\u2019t like either the war or the prospect of becoming dependent on NATO. But as it seemed to me, from the point of view of politics, the question has no long been between war and peace. The question that confronts us is like the trolley problem. And perhaps our government has to choose the lesser of two evils.  \n\nRegarding the attitude of the Russians:  \n\nThere are idiots everywhere, that\u2019s a fact. From my observation, a lot of people in Russia are worried about the Ukrainians. The problem is that any attempts to express the opinion against the decision taken by the Russian government are suppressed. Yesterday I was walking along Nevsky Prospekt, and there was a huge number of police cars, ready to catch the protesters. Posts on the Internet are considered treason. Students at my university are being expelled for taking part in demonstrations. The media of all countries lie, and the Ukrainians in the comments psychologically put pressure on the Russians, asking to participate in demonstrations even at the cost of our own lives.  \n\nI am writing this post with fear that the government of my own country will consider me a traitor. But my desire to convey this information is too strong, because, being Russian, I am tired of hearing from everywhere year after year that Russians are a terrible nation. Please, stop blaming the Russians for everything, our opinion wasn\u2019t asked when this decision was made.  \n\nMy grandfather was a child during World War II. His village was occupied by the Nazis. In front of his eyes, his older brother was blown up on a mine. My grandfather himself once stumbled upon a mine and his finger was torn off. He saw shelling, explosions and enemy planes. He was on the verge of life and death. But he never hated the Germans. Because German soldiers fed him and other Russian children with a food and German chocolate, which was hard to come by even in the 80s.  \n\nAs for myself, I do not hate Ukrainians, and I hope for the same in return. No war is a reason to hate each other. Hatred breeds another hatred, and once this cycle begins, it will never end.  \n\nI have a right to tell this because I know what it\u2019s like to lose relatives. I saw my grandmother\u2019s face when my uncle died. He was a military man, he was killed by other soldiers during the audit, because he did his job too responsibly. I saw my grandmother\u2019s eyes, I saw her go crazy, I saw her give up. She died.  \n\nPlease don\u2019t give up no matter what. Stay safe and don\u2019t give in to the lowest feelings. If you give up, you lose. To lose means to die."}

{"country":"Russia","title":"A massage from Russian student to the world (about Ukraine situation)","sentiment":-0.7579,"text":"The two things that the vast majority of Russians have yet to understand are:\n\n1) The Russian government has been lying and exaggerating the right-wing fascist role in Euromaidan and the subsequent Ukrainian government for 8 years. Originally, because that narrative justified in moral terms the annexation of Crimea and then the continuation of a frozen conflict in Donbas. Never were the majority of Ukrainians, the majority of Ukrainian voters, the majority of Ukrainian armed volunteers, the majority of Ukrainian politicians, the majority of the Ukrainian military right-wing fascists and\/or nazis. Never did the Ukrainian right-wing hold enough power to greatly influence nationally policy and they certainly have failed to maintain any staying power. They were covered by the US media, and widely on the internet, in great part for the sensationalist aspect - Russian media domestically amplified the sensationalism to absolutely absurd heights because Russia's economy tanked and stagnated after 2014 and Ukrainian fascists provided a nice distraction from the extent to which Russia's economy stumbled as well as a rallying cry to unite at least enough Russians behind Putin.\n\n2) The United States did not, despite whatever Obama claims (let's remember Syria at this exact same moment in time was an absolute foreign policy debacle for him) and whatever Paul Robertson (a long retired Reagan-era functionary) claims. Victoria Nuland was a red herring (a metaphor for a distraction), as was all that the Russians \"uncovered\" that America was doing in Ukraine. The US was not committed to resolving the frozen conflict in the Donbas until suddenly it became a hot conflict two weeks ago. NATO was basically disintegrating because it had no purpose... until two weeks ago. Narratives about NATO as a unified entity, as a diabolical platform for the destruction of Russia, are just absolutely so absurd to people who study international security from around the rest of the world that Russia and it's foreign policy statements make it a laughing stock simply because all those claims are bullshit. Just like the absurdity of Russia's launch and catastrophic execution of this war so far only reinforces the idea abroad that Russia's strength is spent, that it is a state drowned in its own fantastical propaganda about its own glory and self righteousness. Putin's fumbling of this whole affair has proven that the Russian government, military, economic integrity, and national politics make it at best a second rate regional power that just so happens to have inherited nuclear weapons. Russia has no steadfast friends, no steadfast economic base, no steadfast moral compass and therefore will take years if not decades to even begin repairing its image save for a dramatic change in government (which the US will no orchestrate because the US most of all doesn't want thermonuclear war). NATO - and the vast majority of its members - had no interest in Russia up until about February 24, 2022, and the majority of states in it would have been just as happy without the alliance because NATO was a stumbling block to European economic integration rather than - as Russians claim - the diabolical end point of EU integration. Everything Russians \"know\" about NATO and world politics are solidly based on disinformation, targeted propaganda, and straight up Russian state media lies. Russians view NATO as a foil to the Warsaw Pact - but that's only because they realize the Warsaw Pact was a method of dominating the Eastern Bloc, which was never NATOs purpose in the West. After all, how many NATO member countries did the US invade and how many Warsaw Pact countries did the USSR invade - let's not forget that France even left NATO developed its own nukes, and only ever returned after demanding that it have to make no changes to its own command structure... essentially crippling NATO unity of command for a decade or more. Moreover, nobody wants to destroy Russia. The vast majority of Americans couldn't point to Russia on a map. Americans don't care or think about Russia nearly as much as Russians think about America, and maybe that's quite telling of the old Soviet trick, \"\u041f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0442, \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439.\""}

{"country":"Russia","title":"Do you think Russian schools teaches a fair history towards Ukrainians\/Ukraine?","sentiment":0.0,"text":"I know you're a troll, but let me tell you how the history of Ukraine is really taught. To begin with, the period of Kievan Rus in no way refers to Ukraine except for their current capital and the tribes living on the territory of the current central Ukraina. Kievan Rus began with Novgorod.  \nLater, the territory of Ukraine and Belarus came under the influence of Lithuania\/Poland, which of course split the people who lived in these territories into two camps. By this time, the territories of the Kherson Mykolaiv Donetsk, Lugansk and Odessa regions were not inhabited. These were the bare stipi where the nomadic tribes of Tatars lived. Peasants and bandits rushed there first, both from the territory of the Russian Kingdom and from the territory of Ukraine and became Cossacks there. Russia sought to return the former territories of Ancient Russia and all those who lived there were considered Slavs\/Russians with some differences in culture and language. Such differences existed in many areas of the Russian Kingdom. Moscow, as the center of the new Slavic state, imposed both its own rules and the usual dialect. For example, I can understand 70-80 percent of Ukrainian speech, so this is a dialect of the language, and not a full-fledged language. You don't call American or Australian English a full-fledged language, do you? So we don't think so either.  \nIt is difficult to say about the history of Ukraine, for a while it was united with Poland, but then merged with the history of Russia. People from the territory of Ukraine fought together with the Russians in all wars, they made scientific discoveries, wrote poetry, but then they considered themselves citizens of another country and did not divide each other into nations."}

{"country":"Russia","title":"not allowing Russians to speak Russian in Ukraine, is there any truth to this claim?","sentiment":0.0772,"text":"So, first of all, remember that there are millions of native Russian speakers in Ukraine. And they are somewhat concentrated towards the east and south of the country. There are cities and towns where you can have 90% or 99% of Russian speakers (the numbers shifted post-2014 because it became \"fashionable\" to speak Ukrainian, but Russian is still extremely widespread).\n\nThat said, for example, all formal communication, even on the regional level, must be conducted in Ukrainian. If you're writing a request to your town council or a complaint to the police, or if a doctor is giving you a prescription, it must be in Ukrainian only. Speaking of doctors, the instructions for drugs are usually in Ukrainian only, and for older generations (who need them the most) it can be a serious problem. All movies in cinemas and most TV have to be dubbed into Ukrainian only. In the few largest cities you can have a chance of catching a movie in its original English (with Ukrainian subtitles), but pretty much everywhere else it's Ukrainian dub only. Education is conducted in Ukrainian only (at least officially, although some teachers, with the students' consent, continue to do so in Russian, but that's illegal). There are strict limits on how little non-Ukrainian content you're allowed to show on TV or play on a radio (so, for example, creating a Russian-language TV channel or a radio station that plays exclusively Russian music is illegal). Street signs, only in Ukrainian.\n\nI was finishing my master's degree in 2013, before the conflict and under the allegedly pro-Russian president in the city with nearly 100% of Russian speakers (Donetsk). I was told that my master's thesis could be in any language I wanted except for Russian. I asked, could I do it in English or French? They said yes. How about Chinese? Okay, if you manage to do that. Could I do it in... Swahili? You can try, they said. But not in Russian. They told me, speaking Russian. Not because it was some petty power trip, but for legal reasons.\n\nSo yeah. You're saying you're from Canada, so you must understand the concept of bilingualism. Imagine what would happen if French would be removed from all official capacities in Canada? If it now had all the same rights as Russian or Chinese in your country? Would people be happy about it?\n\nYou can *speak* Russian in Ukraine, but there's a lot of places where you're not allowed to *use* it."}

Economics is the root of everything.  \n\nAfter World War II, the United States built an international trading system based on the dollar.  The Breton-Woods system was even honest at first.  the dollar was backed by gold and it seemed to everyone that it was reliable.  but in 1965, French President de Gaulle demanded that the United States exchange dollars for gold.  It was removed very quickly and soon after that the US announced that the dollar was no longer backed by gold.  in fact, now it is not provided with anything, it's just air.  everyone who does not agree with this, the United States is trying to destroy by military means.  for example, Gaddafi was definitely a terrorist, he blew up planes and nightclubs, but in addition, for example, he promoted projects to supply Africa with water and others.  But when Gaddafi announced the rejection of the dollar and plans to create a \"golden dinar\", he was immediately destroyed.  Now China is interested in destroying the dollar.  However, the US is destroying it with its own hands.  freezing Russia's assets showed all countries that keeping assets in the US is a very bad idea.  Sanctions against Russia could destroy Europe's economy.  Russia China India and some other countries have agreed to create their own payment system based on national currencies.  if China takes control of Taiwan, it will deal a very severe blow to the US economy.  in general, everything looks like everything is just beginning .."}

After the recent changes from 16 oct I can only do so by plane to Sheremetyevo. Some news sources state that it can take from 10 to 16 hours with phones and laptops check to successfully pass through border control in Sheremetyevo. Do any of you guys know whether it's really that bad? Like I understand the special attention, but it sucks to miss my trains that I have tickets for. I'd like to know how long it really takes for ukrainians and other foreigners in general?\n\nI'm a regular guy, all documents are ok, nothing illegal or suspicious.\n\nAnd, just to be clear, I'm using eng to cover more users here.\n\nTy  \n\n\nEdited to add my exp. *Copy of the answer to dair\\_spb for those who are lazy to scroll :)*\n\nWell it was tough. Really stressing, especially for people that are used to simple traveling. The process itself is simple tho.  \n\r\r  \nYou arrive, head to passport control, then they see your ua documents and tell you to wait in a special area that is meant for ua citizens. Then a border officer gives you a form with different questions about your visit, and after you fill it he takes the form and your phone to check. Depending on who you are, checking varies from 6 to 24 hours. E. g. I was there for 12 hours.\r\n\nYou just sit\/sleep there till they call your name to continue. While you wait you can buy snacks using vending machine and find some free water in the hall.\r  \n\r  \nBefore the final decision they interview to gather info about your life and suspicious things they find on your phone. If everything's clear, you are good to go and pick up your luggage."}

Infrastructure - Soviet, except 30 years older, not really renewed, barely hanging on. Education, healthcare - gradually getting worse. Industrial jobs created by the Soviets - gone.

He says:\n\n* Ukraine will not be handed back its territory.\n* Ukraine will never join NATO.\n* The US will not be involved in sustaining a ceasefire.\n\n**This is BEFORE negotiations between Trump and Putin (that do not even involve Ukraine) have even taken place.**\n\nAny single one of these things is enough to guarantee that Ukraine's future existence is completely forfeit.\n\nAsk any honest and competent analyst and they will tell you the same thing: All that these policies can hope to achieve is to delay an even greater onslaught of Ukrainian people at a future date after Putin (or whatever despot that replaces him) has replenished their forces.\n\nThe war will not end - it will be deferred to the aggressor's advantage. Millions more lives will be lost, and this doesn't even include the other flare ups that will take place all over the world as a result of US isolationism and democratic splintering. This is the path that will lead us to World War III.\n\n**This is not a drill.**\n\nThe future of our world comes down to this:\n\nUkraine still has a chance to negotiate on its own terms and prevent a scenario that will lead to even greater catastrophe. It can only do this with the full support of Western (and in particular, European) allies. In order to get that support, politicians within those countries (for the most part) have to believe that it is in their own personal interest to provide unconditional support for Ukraine - the only way that those politicians will provide that support unconditionally, is if the voters of the nations and constituencies they represent make it abundantly clear that **Ukraine is Non-Negotiable**. It is absolutely imperative that the politician believes that his or her job is entirely dependent on both the commitment and follow-through of supporting Ukraine financially, humanitarian, and militarily.\n\n**We have to rally and demonstrate like the world depends upon it, because it does. We need to get as many people as possible attending demonstrations and contacting their political representatives so that the issue cannot be ignored.**\n\nWe do not have a lot of time. February 24th will mark 3 years since russia's full scale invasion - it is the natural time that politicians will look out for in order to gauge to what degree they might be forthcoming with the issue on the national and international stages. They will ask whether or not the people with the power to keep them in elected positions are still active in their support of the Ukrainian people or if they have forgotten about them.\n\nWe need all hands on deck to make this work. If you reading this right now, share this post and the poster we have provided on all available platforms. Check the website [https:\/\/standwithukraine.org\/](https:\/\/standwithukraine.org\/) to find out where the nearest demonstration event is to you. If there is no Pro-Ukrainian demonstration in your nearest major city, **Seriously Consider Making One** and adding it to the map provided on the website.\n\n* Translate the poster and this post if you are able to and share it to Non-English speaking communities on all available platforms - Reddit, Twitter, BlueSky, Instagram, Facebook, even TikTok (then get rid of TikTok).\n* Bug your favourite influencers until they repost or give a shoutout to the world-wide demonstrations.\n* **Comment on this post**, seriously, just do it. Comment on every post you see that tells people about the world wide demonstrations. Just straight up start conversations with people in the comment sections. Social Media algorithms are trained to prioritise engagement, brute-force hack that algorithm.\n* Find out who your local, regional, and national political representatives are and bug the living crap out of them. Make sure they get the message and don't quit until they've made a public statement committing to supporting Ukraine with political, humanitarian, and military aid - **whatever it takes**.\n\nDon't give up. There is too much riding on this for us to lose. If we do not act now, it will not only be ourselves who pay the price for our inaction, it will be our children, and their children, and their children's children, for countless generations to come. I cannot overstate this. The fight for Ukraine is the fight for the freedom of this world. The fate of that world will be determined by the events of the coming weeks.\n\n**Ukraine is non-negotiable.**\n\nMake sure our Ukrainian brothers and sisters know that we're still here. Remind them that they are not forgotten, and that they never will be.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k7p83bu29gje1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d97e2c68a31ea11c801dfebb103acf7f63eb254\n\n"}

I know this is probably mostly an emotional response and a way to put pressure on the west to allow them entry into NATO, but if NATO won't sack up and accept the country that is literally doing their job in terms of suppressing russian aggression in Europe, I fully support Ukraine firing up the reactors and developing their own nuclear arsenal. \n\nNever before in the history of the world has there ever been as justifiable a reason to produce nuclear weapons as a deterrent. This isn't a case of the Iranians wanting to make a nuke to kill all the jews, or NK wanting to keep their dear leader in power via a nuke program. This is an existential threat to a country that literally had a nuclear arsenal and gave them up the country that is literally invading them. The other signees on the contract, while UA is grateful for the aid, simply aren't doing enough to help AND are holding Ukraine back from defending itself. NATO won't give a clear pathway to membership. All but guaranteed russian stools like Hungary and Slovakia will vote against them. Germany is too busy quivering in fear in the corner. Other member states can't\/won't\/don't have the resources to help further.\n\nUkraine has been tossing the west lifeline after lifeline to prove they are worthy of being accepted into the west's club. They fight within the rules of war and with honor. They fight within the frame of the Geneva convention. They do all of this while their opponent does the complete opposite and without remorse. They do all this while aid is drip-fed to them and when they do get it, they are forced to adhere to western fears of escalation and watch their citizen die day after day by attacks that could be be stopped by simply telling them \"yes go ahead\". Don't think I have ever witnessed an entity fight back with such restraint and within such nonsense escalatory rules before and still have a fighting chance. \n\nSimply put, UA will do what is best for itself and better to ask forgiveness later then permission now. The west has had chance after chance after chance to nip the russian problem in the bud dating back to the 90s, and still thought it was wise to do business with them and extend them non-stop olive branches. That very clearly isn't working, hasn't worked, and never will work. Russians only understand the language of force (something the west has failed to learn) and Ukraine is the only one speaking that same language. The west is so afraid of russian redlines, but perhaps it's time they learn Ukrainian ones. Show them a pathway to membership, help them get there ASAP, or learn to have another nuclear state in Europe.\n\nThe west has no one else to blame but themselves that it has reached this stage."}

He joined  not because of sheer patriotism, but because he wanted to give either his own childern, or the childern  of other Dutch people the chance to live in freedom in case he died (and he needed the resistance for something, but the resistance worked kinda like a mafia organization, you do something for them, making you a criminal in the eyes of the Germans, before they did something for you).\n\nMy grandpa had a best friend in the resistance, his name was Hans and they did a lot together and became good friends. However, one night they planned to steal something from a warehouse, but the plan failed and they got shot at. My grandpa and other resistance members had to flee while bullets flew around him. Hans was around 5 meters away from him, but he got hit and died.\n\nGrandpa always asked the question \"why he, and not me\" he always tells us that not the best survive war, but the lucky ones. However he also told us that if he wasn't lucky, and he got killed instead of Hans, he would've gladly have died so Hans could raise his children in freedom instead of him. Hans believed in a free Netherlands, and an environment where they could live in freedom.\n\nNow Grandpa is 100, but he says he simply choose not to die yet cuz he still doesn't know what to tell Hans (and other resistance buddies) in heaven. But if he decided what to tell him, he will be dead. So if we find him dead in his sleep, he decided what to tell Hans.\n\nNot sure if this story helps you, but you have to move forward and carry on cuz your husband died because he believed your son should be raised in freedom, you should live in freedom, and the children of his warbuddies should live in freedom. He died because he believed in both you and a free Ukraine. Always move forward not for your own sake, but because he believes in you even in heaven. And he probably wants you to turn old before you can come to him in heaven.\n\nIf you have questions or want to know details you can always DM me. I visit grandpa this weekend, so if you want I can ask him a question for you."}

Aside from his 100% anti-Ukrainian voting record, he goes above and beyond to promote Russian narratives: Ukraine cannot win, Ukraine should cede land to end the war, Ukraine is corrupt and the US is writing it blank checks. He went as far as repeating the fake story about Zelensky's yacht, and published[\u00a0this op-ed in the NYT against continuing to support Ukraine](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/04\/12\/opinion\/jd-vance-ukraine.html). I've had a personal interaction with a Senator's aide who told me a disturbing story about JD Vance laughing during a meeting about Ukraine.\n\nI know there are still some who consider that Trump might be an improvement over Biden. I know your arguments well and have written before about why I find this unlikely. Choosing JD Vance as VP makes this prospect even more remote. JD Vance was selected for his\u00a0[unwavering loyalty to Trump](https:\/\/snyder.substack.com\/p\/trump-seeks-vice), and their shared desire to\u00a0[remake the American government](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AccountableGOP\/status\/1812940196062642365)\u00a0after seizing power.\n\nHowever, JD Vance is smarter, younger and more ideological than Trump. Vance's worldview and goals are inspired by the writings of\u00a0[Curtis Yarvin.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Curtis_Yarvin)\u00a0You can read Yarvin's views on Ukraine\u00a0[here](https:\/\/graymirror.substack.com\/p\/a-clarification-on-ukraine)\u00a0and\u00a0[here](https:\/\/graymirror.substack.com\/p\/ukraine-the-tomb-of-liberal-nationalism)\u00a0- it should make where Vance is coming from a lot clearer.\n\nI urge those not indifferent to both America's and Ukraine's future to vote accordingly and talk to those around you.

We need to make sure Ukraine has what is necessary for as long as necessary, because we cannot allow Putin to win this war,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\nRussia, however, accused the west of escalation and said that Biden risked adding \u201cfuel to the fire\u201d in Ukraine, and while Donald Trump remained silent on the issue, his son Don Jr accused the military industrial complex of wanting to get \u201cworld war three going\u201d.\n\nStorm Shadow missiles have a range of about 250km, similar to the US Atacms, and have in the past been given to Kyiv by the UK and France to strike targets inside Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognised borders.\n\nBut the US retained an effective veto on their use because it supplies a guidance system and repeated lobbying by the UK had failed to shift the US position, which has only begun to soften after the election victory of Donald Trump earlier this month."}

We're in this one way or another whether we'd like to be or not, and not investing now will cost us more in money and lives later. In the highly probable event of another Trump presidency, Putin may be tempted to take his chance with another country less well equipped, like Moldova or revisiting Georgia. And if that works, and if Trump looks like he'll let him get away with it, and if he continues to be fed what he wants to hear by his own intelligence services, he might try the same with a NATO country (especially if Trump pulls the US out of NATO). That sounds insane but Putin is not known for his rational nature at this point. Best to wear them down now rather than having to face them ourselves later.\n\nEven from a purely economic point of view, the cost in raised food prices from a full occupation of Ukraine alone would be more to the British public than the taxes spent on arms to prevent that."}

Many seem to think so","sentiment":-0.8695,"text":"There are plenty of other factors:\n\n- Proximity. People care more about things happening on their doorstep than things happening on the other side of the world.\n\n- Frequency. Major land wars in Europe are extremely unusual and don\u2019t happen very often (arguably the last major land war in Europe was the Second World War). On the other hand, wars in places like the Middle East and Africa are common, so don\u2019t get as much news coverage (news is supposed to be _new_)\n\n- Social media. The Ukraine conflict is all over social media, and theres so much footage that we\u2019re pretty much watching it happen live. This is not the case for many conflicts in poorer countries where fewer people use social media and have smartphones (although there are plenty of youtube videos). \n\n- The speed of the deterioration. Ukraine has gone from being a middle income country to a warzone in only a couple of days. \n\n- The overwhelming numbers of the Russian army. People love \u201cDavid vs Goliath\u201d stories. \n\n- The nuclear factor. Although extremely unlikely, there is a very small chance this could end with most of the planet becoming radioactive.\n\n- Demographics. Ukraine has stopped all their fighting age men from leaving, prioritising the evacuation of women and children. On the other hand, refugees from the middle east and Africa have been mostly young men. This has raised a couple of eyebrows as to whether they are in fact economic migrants, as economic migrants tend to be mostly young-middle aged men, but one would expect refugees to either contain a spread of ages and even mix of genders, or mainly be women and children. \n\nThere are many more factors, but putting it all down to racism is too simplistic (and often an attempt to smear those who care about the war in Ukraine). It\u2019s also unreasonable to expect everyone to care equally about everything.\n\nEdit: And many people _did_ care about these other wars- for example, the war in Iraq triggered some of the largest protests in modern history."}

There is a reason that Europe continues to rely so heavily on the US for defence, and that reason is that historically US administrations have **wanted** us to. American foreign policy is the default western foreign policy, and that privileged position is bought largely through the outsourcing of defence matters to the US - that doesn't just include physical defence of Europe but also the ability to project force abroad to influence events around the world. They're the ones who can affect things, so they're the ones who get to decide in what manner things should be affected. \n\nThe corollary to a resurge in European defence spending is that Europe's going to be significantly less willing to toe the US line when it comes to making foreign and defence policy decisions, and I don't think that that's fully appreciated by those advocating it in the states.\n\nAll that said though, in principle from a UK point of view I think that that's fine in the long term. I think if Europe rebuilds both its military and defence-industrial capabilities to the point that we can guarantee our own security at home and abroad then so much the better. I don't think that necessarily includes abandoning the Indo-Pacific - there's some areas we should still be involved, particularly the industrial and technological cooperation with Australia and Japan - but if they want us to focus forces in the Atlantic and Europe - fine."}

They're really doing a lot, way more than I would have expected.\n\nMy background. I'm a dual British-Ukrainian citizen living in the UK. I have a family here, and I also have a son from the previous marriage in Ukraine. He's 14. He never planned to come and live in the UK, he was quite happy in Ukraine. That obviously changed and I'd like to somehow get hold of him.\n\nHis mum agreed to try and bring him to a neighbouring country (Moldova or Poland maybe), and I thought I would just go and fetch him to bring him to the UK with.\n\nReading so many news about supporting Ukrainian refugees I thought it would be a piece of cake from the legal point of view, but, alas, the only thing that the government relaxed so far is taking your immediate family member to the UK if you're a British citizen living in Ukraine:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/support-for-family-members-of-british-nationals-in-ukraine-and-ukrainian-nationals-in-ukraine-and-the-uk\n\nWhich is the right step forward, of course. \n\nBut since I don't live in Ukraine, I can only apply for the general family visa:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.gov.uk\/uk-family-visa\n\nWhich is quite expensive (\u00a31,500  + \u00a32,350 NHS surcharge), and there's no super priority option. Meaning if he escapes to Moldova and I meet him there, we'll have to apply for visa and wait for months in a country we have no connection to for a decision that might be negative.\n\nThe money is a concern, but it could be borrowed; I'm mostly worried about all that long waiting for the decision.\n\nIn any case, could someone confirm my understanding is correct and applying for a family visa seems to be our only option? \n\nIf that's correct, is there any way to try and influence the government to further relax the rules in a more meaningful way?\n\nPlease pardon my English. I'm a confident and fluent speaker of English, but it's not my native language.\n\nAlso, I know immigration is a controversial topic, but could you please try and avoid saying any mean things to me, cause the life is stressful enough even without being abused on reddit for bringing up controversial issues."}

{"country":"UK","title":"British Army warns its soldiers not to go rogue and travel to Ukraine","sentiment":-0.5698,"text":"\n\nThe British Army will on Tuesday warn soldiers not to travel to Ukraine to take up arms as it risks triggering a major escalation in the conflict.\n\nThe cautionary order comes after Downing Street rebuked Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, who said she \"absolutely\" supported British nationals fighting against the Russian invasion.\n\nIn a daily message to every soldier, seen by The Telegraph, known as a Part 1 Order, Sir Chris Tickell, the second in command of the army, will say on Tuesday: \"There has been some recent media coverage relating to foreigners being welcomed into Ukraine to help fight against Russia.\n\n\"To be clear, as members of the British Army, you are not authorised to travel to Ukraine to support the ongoing conflict against Russia in any form, whether you are on leave or not. Please remain professional and focused on your duty and your team.\"\n\nThe Telegraph understands the Army fears that soldiers seen with British insignia in Ukraine could trigger a major escalation in the conflict.\n\nCommanders were last night warned of \"rumblings through back channels of some soldiers considering [going to Ukraine]\".\n\nThe internal memo said that not only would this be \"very bad from a reputational and presentational point of view\", but \"more worryingly, at its worst, it could lead to miscalculation, which we need to guard against.\"\n\nBritain has vowed not to send troops to Ukraine and any deployment, even if unofficial, risks provoking retaliation from Russia and widening the conflict. \n\nIt came as Downing Street knocked down the Foreign Secretary amid warnings that British nationals might be breaking the law if they travel to fight in Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman insisted on Monday that he \u201cfully recognises the strength of feeling\u201d among Britons who want to help, but reiterated the Government's advice not to travel to Ukraine.\n\nBen Wallace, the Defence Secretary, also urged Britons not to join the fighting, saying that the \"very dangerous\" situation could lead to them being killed.\n\nA Foreign Office source admitted that there could be legal consequences for Britons who travel to Ukraine to fight against the Russians.\n\n\u201cIt is legally murky\u201d, the source said, adding those who go out to Ukraine to fight \u201cdo so at their own risk, legally or otherwise\u201d.\n\nThe Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 makes it illegal for a British citizen to fight in a war involving a nation state which is at peace with the UK. But experts say that in practice this piece of legislation is not always applied and is unlikely to be in the case of Ukraine.\n\nEd Arnold, research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute, said the nineteenth century law was \u201cnot particularly enforced\u201d when thousands of Britons went to join the Spanish civil war in the 1930s, nor is it currently enforced against dual nationals who are conscripted to fight in foreign armies such as the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\n**Foreign legionnaires: Veterans buy kit at Army surplus stores en route to Ukraine**\n\nThey are heading to Ukraine with years of experience under their belts. But first they need to buy a belt. And fatigues. And a flak jacket.\n\nHundreds of Britons with military experience are believed to be readying to enter Ukraine as part of the country\u2019s new army of foreign legionnaires to bolster the fight against Russian troops that invaded last week. Among them are at least 20 veterans of special forces operations.\n\nFew of them still have their own kit, however, prompting last-minute shopping trips to army surplus stores.\n\nAt Folkestone\u2019s G4 Echelon Military Supplies, owner Damon Warren - a 52-year-old ex-soldier - is giving a 50 per cent discount to both Ukrainians and any British veterans seeking to help them. Ever since the invasion began, Mr Warren said his phone had been ringing incessantly.\n\nAmong the callers is Andrew Lester, a 25-year-old electrician from Kent who served in the Parachute Regiment till last July, reaching the rank of lance corporal. Mr Lester has his own boots, but he needs a helmet, body armour, and gear for cold and wet conditions.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainians are really doing quite well, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re holding out. If they need a few more blokes to push them\u201d \u2013 the Russians \u2013 \u201cback, then that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nMr Lester said he knew of more than 100 former soldiers who were also planning to join the fight against Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d invasion: \u201cIf it was the UK, I\u2019d like help from other countries. So why not, eh?\u201d\n\nUkrainian civilians might not have experience of handling military equipment, Mr Lester added, meaning that the expertise of British veterans could be of assistance.\n\nOwner Mr Warren said he had been turning away Britons who were not veterans because those with neither military experience nor the ability to speak Ukrainian would be \u201cmore of a liability than a help.\u201d\n\nSome of Mr Lester\u2019s colleagues in the group of ex-Paras hoping to fight for Ukraine are veterans of special forces missions. They include Dave Radband, 36, who was part of special forces missions in Afghanistan and Iraq and now is the director of a railway engineering company.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got 10 tours under your belt, you\u2019ve got a unique skillset,\u201d Mr Radband said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit around. It comes down to morals. You can\u2019t just sit around and let this happen. They need our help, so we\u2019ll go out and help them.\u201d\n\nHundreds of veterans were making similar plans, Mr Radband added. Of the 30-strong group of which he and Mr Lester are a part, Mr Radband estimated that 20 had been in the Special Forces Support Group.\n\nThey had felt a call to action, Mr Radband said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fight for ourselves. We\u2019re protectors.\u201d\n\nThe Folkestone store has also received hundreds of orders of kit from Ukrainians making purchases either for themselves or for their countrymen.\n\n\n\nMr Warren spent Monday at his depot handing over thousands of pieces of kit, the vast majority of which is going to Ukrainians. Four were loading boxes with uniforms when The Telegraph visited, stripping off badges bearing the Union flag under instruction from Mr Warren.\n\nMr Warren said he was making no profit from the kit he was selling. \u201cI\u2019ve been to war zones and I\u2019ve seen what it does. So my heart is with the Ukrainians, and my heart is telling me to help them as best I can.\u201d\n\nTwo of the shop\u2019s Ukrainian customers were a pair of brothers: Andriy Batuk, 39, and Roman Svisun, 46. The brothers, each of whom has lived in the UK for several years, were buying kit that they and a friend were about to drive to the Ukrainian border, before returning to do the same thing again.\n\nThey might end up having to fight, said Mr Batuk. For the time being, they had to hurry off to the continent, laden with gear. \u201cWe have to do it, otherwise he\u201d \u2013 Vladimir Putin \u2013 \u201cwill destroy us. We will disappear as a nation.\u201d"}

If someone was attacking England or someone was attacking my wife or my son, I would take a gun and go and fight,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThis is not the place for me to fight. I\u2019m not going to get a gun and start shooting.\u201d\n\nThe father added: \u201cI hate what Russia is doing at the moment. I\u2019m definitely against the war and the war that Putin is doing. But I just want to come back home and see my family.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has set up a petition calling on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to those in Ukraine. To sign the petition click here.\n\nRussia launched an attack on Ukraine by sea, air and land on Thursday after the threat had loomed for weeks. Since then, rocket strikes have fallen on cities and heavy fighting has taken place across the country.\n\nIn the first four days of the attack, Ukraine\u2019s health ministry said more than 350 civilians - including 14 children - were killed.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations estimated half a million people have fled across the border so far.\n\nMr Chumak was not one of them. He has tried to cross three times - but was turned back each one.\n\nThe 39-year-old said border officials told him: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here. You should be up front fighting for your homeland.\u201d\n\nThe UK resident, who works in a hotel in London, said he tried to explain that even though he had a Ukranian passport, he did not live there and his wife and son were in England. \u201cMy life is elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is just a broad rule that all the men, regardless of the situation, are not allowed to cross the border. The scenes at the border when all the men been parted from their families, like wives and children ... it has been horrific,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spent three nights at the border trying to cross, during which time more and more people started turning up. Temperatures were about 5C and people would have to queue for several hours to use a petrol station toilet.\n\n\u201cThe food started running out at the border,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cI saw the body of a woman who literally died at the petrol station.\u201d\n\nMr Chumak said he could not get any medicine when he started to fall ill - and ended up returning back to his parents\u2019 home several hours inland to recover.\n\nHe will wait there and try and find a way to come back home to London \u201cat the first opportunity\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is just not my place to fight,\u201d the father-of-one said.\n\nHis British wife, Nicola O\u2019Donnell, told The Independent, she had been in touch with embassies and the Foreign Office to try and get her husband - who has indefinite leave to remain in the UK - back home, but had not had any luck so far.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s says he\u2019s not British, there\u2019s nothing we can do. They were not very helpful,\u201d the 47-year-old, who met her husband while they were both working in Pizza Hut in Kensington, said.\n\nShe is now trying to stay positive for their 12-year-old son, who says he wants to \u201cmake his dad proud\u201d in his football games. Mr Chumak manages his son\u2019s football team.\n\nThe Foreign Office declined to comment. The British Embassy in Ukraine has been approached for comment."}

Not being on the front line is no guarantee of safety, especially when Russia has been bombing children's hospitals and orphanages. That's a very understandable and human feeling to have.\n\nAnd he has a family, with a 12 year old son. The thought that he doesn't want to leave his son without a father has probably gone through his mind, and I can't blame him for that either. I deeply admire the courage of the people who have signed up to fight but I sympathise with this guy too, and I just can't find it in me to blame him for wanting to stay safe and go home to his family."}

But the reality is neither party is willing to do what\u2019s necessary for a Ukrainian victory, and now that Trump is in power Ukraine is doomed unless there is a major increase in manpower, ammunition and repair efficiency, something Russia has a major advantage over Ukraine.\n\nI think people that say he will agree to peace when he gets the 5 Oblasts he claims (Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea) are incredibly optimistic. The reality is that Putin knows his forces can achieve much more than that under a Trump presidency by just fighting. Expect him to ask for Sumy, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv and who knows what else. \n\nIf NATO membership or at the very least a peace keeping force is not agreed, then expect Ukraine to become a Russian puppet state."}

Ukraine cannot negotiate peace without sufficient military strength. Corbyn's position is too simplistic, he is mistaken that providing weaponry will neccessarily prolong the war. Failing to provide adequate support to Ukraine could indeed result in a shorter war, but with Russian gains which would represent an increased threat to neighbouring countries and to the West. Corbyn is right in that much more effort must be put into the negotiation for peace, although it will be incredibly difficult to negotiate with Russia while Putin remains in power. It's not an either-or question; to shorten the war, increased efforts for peace must be simultaneously backed up by increased defensive capabilities. \n\nHaving said this, I think Corbyn is playing an important role, there must be somebody calling for negotiations otherwise our national postition would be purely militaristic, placing us in diametric oppostion to Russia and negating our role in the possibility for progress in any peace talks. As he has done in the past, he is placing himself in the difficult position of interlocutor, and as such will recieve a great deal of criticism as a 'sympathiser' which is clearly baseless."}

Instead, UK will simply issue a bond secured by the russian assets.\n\nSo when UK transfers this bond to Ukraine, it will create a debt that Ukraine will have to repay the UK, presumably with interest.\n\nNow let's assume that some time in the future, russia finally decides (or is forced) to F off from all occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Ukrainian territorial integrity is restored, the war is won. What happens next? Sanctions come down, all the russian assets in the UK become unfrozen.\n\nNow UK owes russia interest on all these years russian money has been in UK banks. And in turn, Ukraine owes the UK interest on bonds secured against this money.\n\nSo in a sense, Ukraine will become indebted to russia by proxy of UK. Instead of the proper way of russia having to pay Ukraine reparations for all the destruction they caused. No, paying money to russia after winning war against them does not sound like a good idea.\n\nI hope this is just me completely misunderstanding the mechanism Cameron is proposing, and in reality we won't be paying interest to UK which will then go to russia."}

So, if someone is rude to you, they are bad at controlling their mood, and you haven't done anything to them other than exist to earn the negativity that just got dumped on you. It still happens, but - we write that person off as an asshole and get on about our day.\u00a0\n\n\nThe \"I'll be nice if I feel like it\" aspect to culture here I experience as very antisocial, because there is a truth to the way I was raised, I see it. People here can be negative under the guise of realism but the general, low-lying pessimism brings me down, and other outsiders experience it the same way.\u00a0\n\n\nI find the stunting of emotions, where you are raised to be indifferent to others' emotional state, somewhat unnatural, as we are social creatures, after all.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, yeah.

{"country":"Germany","title":"Zelensky to Bundestag: Germany shares blame for delays in Ukraine's NATO, EU integration.","sentiment":-0.5413,"text":"Well, that's not much of an article. It's barely longer than the headline.\n\nAs much as I understand Zelenskyy's extreme frustration -- and of course he's going to beg for membership of both NATO and the EU -- there are good reasons why, right now, this would be the wrong thing to do.\n\nEU membership isn't a thing that can be fast-tracked. Any country wanting to join the EU must adhere to a very strict set of criteria. Turkey has been trying to get in for decades but has failed to meet the criteria every time; you can't hand instant membership over to a country just because it's been invaded.\n\nAnd of course, the moment Ukraine joined the EU and NATO, those entities would themselves be at war with Russia. It's tempting to think that this would help Ukraine, because then Russia would be up against the full might of the West etc. etc., but it would amount to a declaration of war and an escalation that would give Putin the excuse he needs to deploy biological, chemical, or -- if he's insane enough -- nuclear weapons. And that's exactly what we have to avoid.\n\nUnderstand that the Putin propaganda machine is attempting to blame \"NATO expansion\" and \"western aggression\" for the invasion. He's using classic bully-boy tactics: he's trying to provoke the west into declaring war, so that he can bomb London, Washington and New York, as well as finally lay waste to Kyiv (with a small, tactical nuke, if necessary).\n\nIf there is any hope for less destructive end to this war, it lies in giving Putin a way for him to retreat while claiming victory. Time for this strategy is running out, as he is showing more and more signs of paranoia, but it can still work.\n\nHe's on the back foot, his invasion has all but stalled, Ukrainians are fighting back harder than ever, and the Russian economy is shot to ribbons. If there are any military strategists who think he could actually win, I don't know of them.\n\nSo a possible way out for Putin is for us to say that if he withdraws his troops now and stops the air and missile attacks, we can ensure that Ukraine stays neutral and then he can claim that he has successfully \"stopped NATO expansion\" and thus the \"special military operation\" has achieved its main aim. We can send neutral UN peacekeeping forces into Donbas and Luhansk, and start work on providing Ukraine with the humanitarian and economic aid it so badly needs.\n\nAnd if we can do that, then we can figure out how to get Putin in front of a war crimes tribunal. But right now, our first priority is to stop the killing, and that's not going to be done by providing Putin with the excuse he needs to kill even more people than he already is."}

Having arrived here, I continued to work remotely for a Ukrainian company. When it became clear that I would stay in Germany for a long time, I took intensive German courses and quit my job. I also started learning front-end development on my own. Having researched the job market in Germany, I was upset: all employers require a diploma in computer science. In Ukraine, a higher education diploma is not a prerequisite for getting a job in the IT field. In Ukraine, I received a bachelor diploma in tourism business management. I have never worked in this field. I worked as a translator from Turkish (which I learned myself). And for the last 4 years I have worked at an Affiliate company as a customer service manager. After the start of Covid, I completely switched to remote work. And then the war began.\n\nSo my question is how can I find a job as a front-end developer in Germany.\nWhat do I have?  I'm currently learning German to get it to B1 level. I already feel more or less fluent in html\/CSS. Now I have started to intensively study JavaScript. I'm already a little familiar with APIs and React. In the future I will also learn Typescript and .NET. My learning assistants: Odeon project, course on Udemy and, of course, Google. \n\nNow my question is: what do I need to find a job in Germany? I am a woman, I am 29 years old. I live in the small town of Rheda-Wiedenbr\u00fcck, North Rhine-Westphalia. I don't have the opportunity to enroll in a bachelor's degree. Should I go and do Ausbildung?

You can get easier into companies like that, and then you pivot and offer coding skills in your team and prove you can do it.

{"country":"Germany","title":"Can you truly belong to German (or continental European) society if you are an immigrant? Will you ever be accepted as one of them? Are Anglo Saxon countries just better in this regard? Do any other well-integrated long-term residents feel continuously rejected?","sentiment":0.4404,"text":"I know its long, but its worthwhile, I promise.\n\nFor starters: I am white and from Australia. So my experiences could not be called racism. It is more subtle and harder to prove; which is why some often wonder if I am actually imagining all this. I have now lived in Germany for the past 20 years (half my life). I switched citizenship in 2016 and now possess only the German one (The German government required me to give up my Australian one!). I speak near perfect German, but with an accent. But I have come to the conclusion that Germans construct a barrier around themselves when interacting with people who don\u2019t belong to their \"tribe\". I feel that if you were not born in this country you will never have a sense of fully belonging to German society (And even if you were born here, you may still have problems. I.e. not being white). There are always subtle traits of Germans letting you know that you are not one of them. This can involve:\n\n\\*Switching to English (I still have not yet met a German who speaks better English than I speak German; and this is not just me being egoistic). I don\u2019t need help with my German. I am not an English teacher on wheels who gives free lessons. But this happens to me every day, even with people I have known for 20 years! But in a deeper sense I think switching to English mid conversation is an unconscious method of protecting their tribe from outsiders. I.e. the same way that a couple may have a certain (romantic\/cute) way of speaking to each other alone, Germans like to protect their language and only speak it with their kind. And here I am not talking about at the \u00c4mter or in the train (where newly arrived foreigners are forced to speak German), but rather with people I actually know and who know my German level.\n\n\\* Completely ignoring me when I ask a question. And no, this is not because they didn\u2019t understand my German! I.e. pretending they didn\u2019t hear.\n\n\\* Switching eye contact from me to my (German) girlfriend as soon as they hear my accent. Example: I was on holidays in Greece and we met another German couple, by chance, multiple times in a restaurant. They remembered us and offered us the remainder of their wine bottle because they wanted to go. Probably, since I was the man, they both directed their initial conversation at me. This particular time it took them a few minutes to pick up on my accent. But as soon as they detected it they seemed really confused, if not threatened. After that, including multiple other times where we popped into each other in some other villages nearby, they did not look at me and their focus shifted to my girlfriend \u2013 which is ironic because she was ignored at first for being a woman: they wanted approval from the man regarding the wine bottle!\n\n\\*Continously emphasizing the fact that you are not from Germany. \n\nAll of the above and other such similar subtle things have happened to me every day in Germany for the past 20 years. They happen too often for me to be imagining them.\n\nA lot of people say it is better in some other continental European countries. In terms of simple interactions like in a caf\u00e9 or on the street, it is indeed easier and more relaxed in France, the Netherlands, Denmark, etc. However in terms of being accepted into society it is exactly the same as in Germany; and in Sweden or the Netherlands I would say it is even much worse (their tribes are much smaller the German tribe \u2013 so it needs to be protected even more). For example: imagine if a 20 year foreigner moves to a continental European country, gets citizenship, learns the language to near perfect, becomes accustomed to the culture, history, etc. 20, 40, 60 years later will the \u201cnative\/ethnic\u201d citizens accept this person as a German, Frenchman\/woman, Dane, etc. Absolutely not, at least 90-99% of them will not. If that same people moves to Australia\/ US\/ Great Britian\/ Canada\/ New Zealand? Absolutely yes; at least, say 70-90%, will accept them as one of their own. There are two reasons for this:\n\n1.For a large portion of the continental Europe (I.e. in Germany AFD, CDU voters) nationality = ethnicity.\n\n2.For the remainder: at an absolute minimum you have to be born there, go to school there, speak the language without an accent, etc. (Auf Deutsch: \u201csozialisiert\u201d). This explains why most young (progressive) Germans would actually consider a 10, 15, 20 year old of Turkish\/ Italian\/ Russian\/ Greek\/ Polish origin to be \u201cone of them\u201d, but do not consider me to be one of them, even if I have lived in the country far longer.\n\nI grew up in Sydney and there I knew multiple immigrants who were in the same situation as me now: they had lived about 20 years in Australiaa and were about 40. But not for a second did I even think about whether they actually belonged to this society and whether they were as Australian as me. Of course they were! But I am willing to maintain that not one of the 80 million Germans considers me as German as they are.\n\nI originally thought it was an American\/Australian\/Canadian thing: I.e. countries which have had huge immigration waves for hundreds of years. But that doesn\u2019t explain why immigration is (generally speaking) much more successful in the UK than in continental Europe. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that it is an Anglo Saxon thing. More precisely an English thing: all the Anglo-Saxon countries have, internationally\/relatively speaking, an English mentality. Sure, most immigrants to the US came from other countries, but these new immigrants adopted the existing English mentality very quickly. Now the question is: Why are the English (Or possibly the British) more accepting of outsiders into their society? I don\u2019t have a definite answer to this. But maybe one possibility is that the UK has not been invaded by foreigners since 1066. There was widespread unrest and even civil wars up until 1689, but it was always Brit vs Brit or Englishman vs Englishman. Now compare this to continental Europe: Nonstop wars, tribe vs tribe, for the last 3000 years, right up until 1945, and in some cases even later: Balkans, Ukraine\u2026 Think about the 30 years\u2019 war in Germany: the Swedish arrived, raped the woman, killed the men, burnt the villages and stole the harvest. The Spanish did the same thing the Netherlands for 80 years from 1568 onwards. And Germans of course were the experts in this field. All these conflicts involved one tribe against another tribe right up until 1945, and in terms of the historical mentality, it is very very recent. 1066, however, is a long time ago! Therefore, I believe in continental Europe the mentality has developed a natural defense mechanism against anything foreign. When such an encounter happens Europeans retreat into their own tribe as an unconscious protection mechanism.\n\nBy the way: Germany more immigrants as a percentage of popluation than the US and the UK! Large scale immigration to the UK also started at the same time as Germany: in the 1950's. So the argument \"we are still getting used to immigrants\" is completely bogus.\n\nSome people have mentioned to me, that that\u2019s just the way it is in Germany\/continental Europe, and that immigrants must accept this when choosing to migrate there. I.e. why should these countries change their whole mentality (assuming that this is even possible to do) because of some whining foreigners. On a superficial level this is true. Maybe I should just leave (Although I have no chance of getting back into Australia at 41 and immigrating at that age is not that easy. I.e. meeting new friends). But continental Europeans have to consider this: How do you seriously expect to compete in the 21st century if most (first generation) immigrants, including very highly skilled ones, don\u2019t feel part of the society? Germany and the rest of continental Europe attracts hardly any Chinese, Indian, and African highly skilled workers compared the Anglo-Saxon countries. E.g., only 4% of Germany\u2019s regular (i.e. excluding refugees) immigration is from outside of the EU. This immigration is a movement from poorer EU countries to richer ones. At some point this immigration will stop or greatly reduce, as Central Europe and countries like Spain and Portugal are growing much faster than Germany.\n\nThe most ironic thing about all of this is that I left Australia because I hated it and generally also the Anglo-Saxon mentality. This was 2003 during the Iraq war. I wanted to live in a country that was proactive on environmental issues, had good public transportation (despite the situation now in Germany its public transportation is still way better than in Anglo Saxon countries), had good bike infrastructure (see point about transportation), free health care, didn\u2019t start wars, that had citizens who were were informed on world issues. And to be fair, I got all of these things by moving here. However, all of these things are nothing compared with the need to have a feeling of being accepted. So the ironic thing is that each day I am developing a larger and larger Anglo Saxon superiority complex. I guess I am being forced to retreat into the protection of my tribe.\n\nGermany: I tried. I learnt the language to a high level, I immersed myself in your literature, film, music. I lived in 4 Bundesl\u00e4nder (Munich, Berlin, Greifswald, Bochum). I joined sports clubs. I joined a political party. But you never treated my any differently from just another random tourist who was in Berlin for the weekend. To save my dignity I got bitter, I (mentally) returned to my people, to my tribe."}

Not even within german universities. Our system is notbuilt for that. Basicly, you apply to study fully at the new university, then after you are accepted you ask if they credit some of your previous courses.

{"country":"Germany","title":"What has made the Ampel (traffic light) coalition so unpopular?","sentiment":0.5423,"text":"A good mix imo.\n\nFor one **Merkel and her gov't before the Ampel had the advantage of being in power during times** **of relative calm**, not requiring many actions. Sure there were some hick ups here and there but the Merkel gov't was doing about nothing for the most time and people interpreted the lack of controversial decissions as \"everyone being happy\" while basically all of our current problems were building up in silence. I remember how frustrating discussing politics was during that time, because everytime you'd bring up an issue, certain people would silence you by saying \"*But honestly now, do we really have it all bad? Life's good with Merkel, so why change anything?*\" ...I guess the calm spoiled them a little.  \nNow we're in a time of seemingly neverending catastrophies, many of them inflicted by the lack of decission making of the last 16 years and people are desperate to return to the quieter Merkel days. Of course the conservatives would have to take similarly unpopular decissions rn if they were in power, dare I remind you that most of the pandemic was handled by them and required taking similarly painful meassures, but it seems their voters just kinda forgot about that.\n\nThen there is the **infighting in the Ampel**. If anything it's remarkable how much they managed to get done in so little time, considering how often this happens. It's just not a good look to the public, people interpret that as a lack of control. It certainly doesn't help that Scholz is barely present as the leader of the gov't to step in and only ever pops up in the news when he loses his laptops or cosplays as a pirate.  \n\n\nA big problem is also the **lack of will to cooperate from the opposition**, especially from CDU\/CSU. Whenever new laws are being discussed Merz and S\u00f6der are immediately against it, even if it means they have to contradict themselves. Not only does this complicate the process of passing laws, but it also divides the public. Of course laws should always be discussed (we live in a democracy after all) but what I'm missing from the CDU\/CSU are constructive proposals on how to improve said laws. Instead they're just wildly gesturing towards some imaginative, magical \"innovation\" that fixes all of our current problems, someone might or might not have somewhen in the future or to just keeping things going as before \"*because there really are no issues*\". Well... And I guess using borderline AfD vocabulary when it comes to discussing issues with our migration system helped none of them, neither the Ampel, nor the CDU\/CSU.\n\nBut imo a very big problem of the Ampel is all the (especially) **online propaganda**. The amount of alarmist, clickbait articles about any new laws the Ampel is discussing, the empty headed memes lacking any kind of substance or message which just serve to insult, and on top of that the alternative (conspiracy) media on YouTube, Telegram and elsewhere, framing themselves as \"independent truth seekers\", receiving undisclosed funding from shady sources, spreading straight up lies confirming people's paranoia.\n\nIt's even more complex then that, but I think this comment is already long enough and I guess those are the biggest problem the Ampel is facing.I personally am somewhat satisfied with them. Of course they aren't perfect, but at least were finally doing something about our problems instead of pretending they don't exist, doing nothing."}

I purposefully won't tell his name or for which country he is a representative because of privacy issues, hope it doesn't come off as tacky.\n\nAnyway, I was submitted a file with topics (the Ambassador's curriculum vitae, presentation of Germany, its internal and international politics and today's-topics). My teacher (who's the one that drafted a couple of students to be there for the diner) encouraged us to talk to the Ambassador about what's in the files.\n\nSubjects range from the GDP, to political parties, to the Chancellor, ... to the next elections, to the far-right party, to the issues with China, to the migration crisis, to the war in Ukraine, to the rise of extremism, and.. you get it.\n\nIsn't it \"rude\" (I can't find the right word, sorry) to talk about these kinds of things at the table? Wouldn't it lead to tension and maybe some bitter aftertaste ? Especially, since we'll be encouraged to start the discussion (which is contradictory because we were also told not to speak if not spoken to, which suggests that the Ambassador will be picking the topics ?). How would you navigate this ? Would you ask questions about these topics ?\n\nI must add that I had a private discussion with my professor who said that my participation was because the Ambassador really like my \"journey\" (I'm an immigrant, and I'll leave it at that to not give out more personal information), which might imply (in my mind at least), that he'll ask me questions about my country and the politics... (which are not good... but where are they good anyway x)).\n\nAlso, I had questions about \u00e9tiquette. If I'm not mistaken, Ambassadors are referred as \"Their Excellency, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany, {their name}\". If I'm making small-talk, is \"Your Excellency\" acceptable or should it be something else ?  What are the do's and the don't's at the table ? I know that elbows are not very polite to have on the table, nor drinking a lot, sitting straight, being quiet when somebody's talking, not talking when your mouth is full... Is there something else ? Something specific maybe to Germans ?\n\nI've browsed other subs but I figured I have the best of luck here.\n\nThanks everyone in advance!!

I personally know a person who desperately needed a student-job to support themselves during their studies and even company is willing to make a contract but only after her extended residence permit arrive. I know there are other way out of that particular situation \ud83d\ude42 but I am just laying out one more example of how far it goes.\n\nThe solution right now is atleast make some reasonably faster way to get the Fiktionsbescheinigung while we wait for work permit or extension of visa. \n\nu\/sweetsoursop in the comments suggested a digitization of the process and even have broken it down to what is required technically \u2764\ufe0f. To people reading that, yes it is that simple! Other countries have implemented it and I am sure there are service based companies who actually would have done and implemented this for other countries so you don't even need to build it in-house or start from scratch. \n\nPeople also have pointed to English language and it's problems legally and some have provided factual counter-arguments to it. Personally, during my visa extensions, I never expect to hold a conversation just with English. I know a little bit of german, use deepl to translate my mails and even go with a few complex vocab and phrases memorized and anyways there's not much to talk if the process is carried out as required. But in situations like this, we have to explain entire thing to staff at the reception or to security, as most places still don't allow inside without appointments. That's why I put little English, where we can frame sentence in English with technical terms in German, and hope that they understand from the context."}

The other two agreed since it seems to very important to Yellow. Everything worked well for some time. Traffic was somehow under control. Just once in a while Yellow screamed: \"I'm the most important here!\". The other two asked why he thinks he is more important, and Yellow said \"Because I always come before both of you!\". Red and Green just thought: \"Well, if you are happy with it.\".\n\nAfter some time the traffic got worse and Red and Green noticed that Yellow had gradually increased the time it was burning between the other two. They said: \"Yellow you can not do that. It disrupts traffic.\". But Yellow screamed \"No, I'm important I have to burn longer than you.\". And Green said: \"Yellow we just allow you to keep your impression of being important, actually you are no more than an indicator that one of us is coming, Red and me are doing the actual work here.\"\n\nNow Yellow was really furious. \"I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU ANYMORE!\" and jumped out of the traffic light. The cars were surprised about the missing Yellow between Green and Red, even the newspapers wrote about it. But after a couple of days they all got used to it and everything worked like normal. \"What was this Yellow all about?\" people asked. Even a friend of Yellow broke up with him and help Red and Green in double shifts.\n\nUnluckily the traffic regulations require to build a completely new traffic light, if a light falls off and the other are not bright enough together.\n\nCome back in a couple of months to hear about the colors of the new traffic light and how mad and important Yellow still is."}

There's other geostrategic considerations at play here, like needing Sevastopol as at least one decent ice free harbor, albeit being in a shitty location, and the possession of Crimea being necessary to project power towards the Sea of Marmara, upgrading this harbor from \"useless wash\" to at least \"sub-optimal\", but those are secondary. Buffers is the one and only thing Russia can do to achieve at least some semblance of security in the geopolitical sense, so having buffers is non-optional for strategic survival.\n\nGermany on the other hand is not so hot on the idea. A sufficiently secure Russia via buffers and anchors at geographic barriers, able to manage internal threats with sufficient pressure, and access to open-ocean ports might very well be able to dominate the Eurasian landmass absolutely and perhaps even rise to a pretender for hegemony. \n\nNot wanting to be dominated by one another is kind of what nations *do*, so it is in Germany's interest for Russia NOT to achieve that security they seek.

{"country":"Germany","title":"German perspective on Ukraine\/Russian conflict and nuclear proliferation","sentiment":0.9501,"text":"In 1994 the Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in accordance with the Budapest Memorandum.  The memorandum said\n\n\"The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine, in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine;\"\n\nConsidering that the Ukraine had the 3rd largest nuclear arsenal at the time, this was probably the biggest move towards nuclear non-proliferation ever.  Now that the Budapest memorandum has been rendered a useless piece of paper by Putin, Ukraine is probably franticly working towards reconstituting its nuclear arsenal.  They certainly have the material and knowledge to do so.   \n\nPer the wikipedia article on Ukraine nuclear weapons\n\"\nPavlo Rizanenko told USA Today that Ukraine may have to arm themselves with their own nuclear weapons if the USA and other world leaders don\u2019t hold up their end of the agreement. He said \u201c\"We gave up nuclear weapons because of this agreement. Now there's a strong sentiment in Ukraine that we made a big mistake.\"(http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/world\/2014\/03\/10\/ukraine-\nnuclear\/6250815\/) [9] He also said that \"In the future, no matter how the situation is resolved in Crimea, we need a much stronger Ukraine. If you have nuclear weapons people don't invade you.\"(http:\/\/www.nationaljournal.com\/politics\/the-ukraine-crisis-is-unsettling-decades-old-nuclear-weapons-agreements-20140312) [10]\n\"\nI would argue that Putin's move to reconstitute the Soviet union with Ukraine has probably in the long term reignited a nuclear arms race in Europe.  I think that the eastern european powers are working to acquire nuclear weapons given that Germany and France have no interest in protecting their borders against Russia.  Given that\n\n\"Germany receives over a third of its gas and oil from Russia and over 6,000 German firms are active there. A poll last week showed that a majority of Germans oppose sanctions against Russia. \"\n\nMy question is, do the German citizenry and government not realize the ramifications of their pursuit of short term economic goals vs the prospect a nuclear arms race in Europe?  Or do you not think that placating Putin will not have long term effects for the security of Europe?\n\nI think that what Germany and France are doing (or rather not doing) will rival the US War on Terror as one of biggest fuckups in the 21st century. Am I wrong?  \n\nI would propose that they take a hit on their economies as they progressively sever economic ties with Russia in exchange for long term security of Europe and nuclear proliferation world wide.

Putin's aggression in Ukrain was done for domestic reasons. He created an atmosphere of hyper nationalism, to distract from domestic problems. That is pretty much like riding a tiger. You have to hold on for dear live or you get eaten. What has he archived? Almost nothing. While Crimea has some important naval bases, it is an economic wasteland and will need huge infrastructure investment to link it with Russia. Donetsk is somewhat more valuable. However, whatever those regions are worth in economic terms Putin over payed (maybe willingly for domestic reason). The removal of foreign investment capital by private companies alone made the whole thing a net loss. And while Germany might be dependent on Russian gas, Russia is even more dependent on German gas money. An invasion is just armed robbery on a grander scale. We willingly wire him more money, than he could ever hope to win by an invasion. Putin wont try to slaughter the goose that he depends on for golden eggs and therefore we will have peace.

{"country":"France","title":"Megathread Ukraine","sentiment":0.0258,"text":"Pour mieux comprendre l'histoire des lettres de cr\u00e9dit, je vais faire une explication super simplifi\u00e9e de comment fonctionne le commerce de mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res.\n\nOn a un producteur de p\u00e9trole qui cherche \u00e0 vendre son p\u00e9trole brut. Avant que le p\u00e9trole soit utilis\u00e9 par le consommateur final il doit \u00eatre raffin\u00e9. Donc le producteur doit trouver un moyer de l'acheminer \u00e0 une raffinerie. Le probl\u00e8me du producteur c'est que la plupart du temps il n'a pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la logistique pour pouvoir le faire car il n'a ni l'argent, ni le temps et ni l'expertise n\u00e9cessaire. \n\nC'est l\u00e0 que rentrent en jeu les courtiers en mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res (commodity traders). Ils ont soit leur propre r\u00e9seau logistique, soit ils ont le capital n\u00e9cessaire pour louer les bateaux, les camions et autres moyens de transport n\u00e9cessaires. Ils ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aussi des terminaux p\u00e9troliers pour stocker le p\u00e9trole si la demande n'est pas suffisante au moment o\u00f9 le producteur veut vendre (car la demande est saisonni\u00e8re et la production ne peut pas toujours s'adapter rapidement).\n\nOr le fait est que le producteur veut \u00eatre s\u00fbr qu'on va le payer, pourquoi est-ce qu'il aurait confiance envers le courtier avec une cargaison qui vaut des millions ? \u00c0 moins que le courtier ne se pointe avec une valise pleine de dollars, il n'a pas envie de vendre son p\u00e9trole. Le probl\u00e8me du courtier c'est qu'il ne se fait qu'une petite marge sur la transaction, il n'a pas l'argent pour payer chaque producteur avec qui il travaille, il ne peut que les payer une fois que les raffineries l'auront pay\u00e9 quand il aura achemin\u00e9 le p\u00e9trole \u00e0 destination. \n\nC'est l\u00e0 que rentrent en jeu les lettres de cr\u00e9dit. La banque du courtier \u00e9met un titre que le courtier peut donner au producteur, qui veut essentiellement dire \"m\u00eame si mon client fait faillite, je te promets de te payer dans 30-60 jours si tu lui donne ton p\u00e9trole en \u00e9change de ce titre\". C'est plus puissant qu'un ch\u00e8que car m\u00eame si le courtier n'a pas suffisamment d'argent sur son compte \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, le producteur sera pay\u00e9 par la banque.\n\nLe producteur peut alors transmettre la lettre de cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 sa propre banque qui lui versera une avance et qui prendra en charge le r\u00e8glement de la dette de la banque du courtier.\n\nAutrement dit, \u00e7a retire quasiment l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du risque du producteur dans la transaction, pour lui la lettre de cr\u00e9dit c'est un super ch\u00e8que qui sera encaiss\u00e9 quoi qu'il arrive.\n\nEn interdisant aux banques russes qui sont les banques de producteurs de gaz ou de p\u00e9trole russe d'utiliser des dollars et d'utiliser SWIFT, on leur interdit d'utiliser des des lettres de cr\u00e9dit libell\u00e9es en dollars (euros, livres et yen aussi) et de n\u00e9gocier facilement avec les banques des courtiers en mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res. \n\nDonc maintenant pour acheter du p\u00e9trole russe, faut soit aller directement en Russie avec des valises de cash, ce qui n'est pas pratique du tout et comme je l'ai dit, les courtiers n'ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas ce cash \u00e0 disposition, ou bien s'arranger avec des banques chinoises pour qu'elles fassent des lettres de cr\u00e9dit en yuan, ce qui rajoute un interm\u00e9diaire, donc baisse les marges qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 faibles et donc n'est pas id\u00e9al non plus, sachant que les producteurs russes n'ont peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pas envie d'accepter un paiement en yuan.\n\nLe r\u00e9sultat c'est que les producteurs russes sont oblig\u00e9s de vendre leur p\u00e9trole et gaz au rabais et\/ou prendre beaucoup plus de risque (ce qu'on appelle en finance le risque de contrepartie)."}

Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.\n\n> Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia. \n\n> Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.\n\n> Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said\n\n> Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.\n\n> The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that \"only Ukraine is real Russia,\" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when \"we lost Ukraine.\" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.\n\n> Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.\n\n> And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.\n\n> Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.\n\n> More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.\n\n> Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.\n\n> Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.\n\n> But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the \"Russian threat\" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.\n\n> Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.\n\n> China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed.

Les influenceurs pro Poutine ont eux aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 pouss\u00e9s dans leurs retranchements.

Ca fait un peu plus de 2 ans que c'est la strat\u00e9gie, et les Occidentaux pour l'instant cherchent \u00e0 soutenir la r\u00e9sistance ukrainienne sans non plus trop s'engager. Et ce n'est pas la fourniture de F16 ou de Mirage 2000 qui vont permettre une victoire militaire de l'Ukraine, faut pas se faire d'illusions. \n\nDu coup, on se retrouve dans une situation o\u00f9 tout est gel\u00e9 depuis \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s un an. Pendant ce temps l\u00e0, les Ukrainiens continuent de se prendre des missiles et des bombes sur la gueule, et leur pays d'\u00eatre ravag\u00e9, tandis que la Russie ne montre toujours pas de signes de rupture, et m\u00eame, au contraire, Poutine appara\u00eet plus renforc\u00e9 que jamais. \n\nDe l\u00e0, trois sc\u00e9narios possibles : \n\n1. Poutine a fait tapis avec son invasion de l'Ukraine et menace constamment les Occidentaux d'un conflit nucl\u00e9aire. On d\u00e9cide de tenir le bluff et on fixe un ultimatum \u00e0 Poutine : Si dans 3 mois les troupes russes ont pas quitt\u00e9 l'Ukraine, l'OTAN rentre dans le pays et les mets dehors avec toute la puissance conventionnelle \u00e0 notre disposition. On regarde si, face \u00e0 cette pression, Poutine se couche ou tente le tout pour le tout. C'est \u00e9videmment une position extr\u00eamement risqu\u00e9e, vu qu'elle a des chances de mener \u00e0 une guerre nucl\u00e9aire. \n\n2. On consid\u00e8re que l'Ukraine ne pourra pas, au vu des moyens humains \u00e0 sa disposition, obtenir des victoires militaires suffisantes pour chasser les Russes hors du pays. On pousse donc l'Ukraine a faire des concessions difficiles (Crim\u00e9e, Donbass) pour obtenir la paix, en \u00e9change d'une int\u00e9gration dans l'OTAN et dans l'UE, et des investissements massifs dans la reconstruction et la modernisation du pays, pour permettre au peuple Ukrainien d'atteindre de biens meilleurs niveaux de vie et de confort et leur offrir un meilleur avenir. Ca implique pour l'Ukraine, et pour Zelinsky, une perte de prestige immense, mais \u00e7a \u00e9pargne la vie des civils. \n\n3. On continue l'approche actuelle, qui est de fournir \u00e0 l'Ukraine suffisamment de mat\u00e9riel pour qu'elle ne s'effondre pas mais pas assez pour qu'elle puisse faire quelque chose de concret. On maintient encore pendant des ann\u00e9es un conflit meurtrier pour les civils, en esp\u00e9rant que la Russie s'\u00e9puise avant nous, ce qui semble compliqu\u00e9 car elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie probablement du soutien chinois en sous main. Ce n'est pas une strat\u00e9gie de sortie, juste un maintien du statu quo, avec n\u00e9anmoins un risque dans le sens inverse d'un effondrement de l'Ukraine sur le long terme.\n\nIl est facile de soutenir la r\u00e9sistance ukrainienne \u00e0 plusieurs centaines de kilom\u00e8tres du front. Ce ne sont pas nos familles, nos amis, nos proches, qui meurent dans les bombardements russes. Ce ne sont pas nos vies qui sont en permanence sous la menace des raids a\u00e9riens, des frappes d'artilleries et des missiles. Il est bien beau de soutenir l'admirable courage du peuple ukrainien sans en avoir \u00e0 en payer le prix. \n\nBref, que chacun fasse son choix en conscience. Mais juste \"Soutenir la r\u00e9sistance ukrainienne\" sans \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 s'engager pleinement dans le conflit, ce n'est pas \u00e0 mes yeux une position de courage. C'est une position attentiste qui se paie avec le sang des Ukrainiens."}

Il nous ressort des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de langage du Kremlin mensong\u00e9s sans sourciller, c'est honteux qu'il en soit encore l\u00e0 apr\u00e8s 3 ans de guerre. \n\nIl a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 nul pour toutes les questions internationales, mais apr\u00e8s 3 ans, on pourrait penser qu'il aurait au moins appris ce qui rel\u00e8ve de la propagande russe. Visiblement non!\n\n> Depuis plus de trois ans, les Europ\u00e9ens et la France d\u00e9cident au sein de l'OTAN de suivre la politique am\u00e9ricaine, de se soumettre \u00e0 la politique am\u00e9ricaine, qui a, en Europe, fait cette guerre par procuration, contre la Russie. Nous, on y est all\u00e9s, et on a pay\u00e9, et puis on est all\u00e9s dans les sanctions, on a accept\u00e9 de se priver du gaz russe\".\n\nDonc les europ\u00e9ens sont seulement des suiveurs des USA et ne sont pas les premiers concern\u00e9s par cette invasion, les USA seraient ceux qui nous ont imposer d'appliquer ces sanctions... C'est une r\u00e9\u00e9criture compl\u00e8te de l'histoire (c'est pourtant pas si vieux que \u00e7a). \n\nQuant au gaz russe, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ce sont les russes qui nous ont coup\u00e9 l'approvisionnement pendant 1 an avant l'invasion de l'Ukraine et livraient au compte-goutte au point o\u00f9 on avait des r\u00e9serves de gaz au plus bas au d\u00e9but de l'invasion, c'est une sacr\u00e9e inversion des responsabilit\u00e9s.\n\n\"On fait cette guerre par procuration\", on est donc des \"co-bellig\u00e9rants\" selon Roussel, nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de langage du Kremlin. \n\n> Il faut aussi revenir sur les causes qui ont pouss\u00e9 cet acte de guerre de la part de la Russie : cette volont\u00e9 des \u00c9tats-Unis de faire entrer l'Ukraine dans l'OTAN, d'aller d\u00e9poser ses missiles nucl\u00e9aires \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re de la Russie en Ukraine. Il faut remettre tout \u00e7a sur la table\".\n\nCa fait 2 mensonges dans 1 seule phrase. Non, il n'y avait pas de volont\u00e9 des Etats-Unis de faire entrer l'Ukraine dans l'OTAN, et encore moins d'aller y d\u00e9poser des missiles nucl\u00e9aires. Roussel recr\u00e2che les mensonges du Kremlin, il ne manque plus que les nazis au pouvoir en Ukraine et on avait le bingo.\n\n> Il fallait tout de suite ouvrir des n\u00e9gociations de paix, insiste Fabien Roussel, garantir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des Ukrainiens et garantir aussi les demandes, les exigences de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la Russie, c'est-\u00e0-dire pas de missiles am\u00e9ricains nucl\u00e9aires \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re russe, la neutralit\u00e9 de l'Ukraine et la garantie de l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 territoriale du peuple ukrainien. \n\nLes Ukrainiens \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 faire des concessions, jusqu'\u00e0 parler de neutralit\u00e9, Poutine n'en a rien eu \u00e0 faire et a gard\u00e9 ses exigences maximalistes tout le long des n\u00e9gociations, dont certaines qui relevaient de l'invention la plus compl\u00e8te (d\u00e9-nazification).

Quand Assad massacrait sa population, c'\u00e9tait son r\u00e9gime qu'il tentait de sauver. Ca n'excuse rien du tout, mais il y avait un enjeu. Poutine n'\u00e9tait PAS dans cette situation, du tout : le pays \u00e9tait stable, les sous rentraient, l'industrie se modernisait, le niveau de vie progressait - avec de tr\u00e8s fortes in\u00e9galit\u00e9s, mais il progressait. Internationalement, il y avait une palanqu\u00e9e d'options pour mettre la pression sur l'Ukraine et n\u00e9gocier sa neutralit\u00e9, voire la reconnaissance de gains territoriaux : NordStream 2, miroiter des avantages de partenariat \u00e9conomique, putain m\u00eame cyniquement financer une opposition \u00e0 un Zelensky pas forc\u00e9ment pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9 pour patiemment et tranquillement arriver \u00e0 ses fins. M\u00eame l'option aggressive d'occuper le Donbass aurait fait grincer des dents mais serait pass\u00e9e. Mais non ! Poutine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire son gros caca pour se faire bien plaisir, et il s'\u00e9tonne de se retrouver dans la merde. Et donc il d\u00e9cide de pourrir la vie de dizaines, non de CENTAINES de millions de personnes parce que son cerveau fini \u00e0 la pisse ne lui permet pas de trouver une solution correcte.\n\nOn a des enfants qui souffrent, des enfants qui meurent, pas par la suite d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements cataclysmiques, mais UNIQUEMENT par incomp\u00e9tence crasse.

Le chef d\u2019\u00e9tat-major des arm\u00e9es (CEMA), le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Thierry Burkhard, a re\u00e7u Le Monde, vendredi 4 mars, dans son bureau de Balard, le Pentagone fran\u00e7ais, situ\u00e9 dans le 15e arrondissement de Paris. Une heure entre deux r\u00e9unions d\u2019un emploi du temps d\u00e9sormais rythm\u00e9 d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 par le pilotage d\u00e9licat du retrait du Mali, et de l\u2019autre par les combats ukrainiens et les nouveaux engagements de la France dans ce conflit d\u2019une violence in\u00e9dite aux fronti\u00e8res de l\u2019OTAN.\n\nLe conflit ukrainien \u00ab faisait partie des options d\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2021, lorsque j\u2019ai pris mes fonctions \u00bb, raconte le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard. \u00ab Des renseignements disaient que les Russes attendraient des conditions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques favorables, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il fasse froid \u00bb, avant d\u2019attaquer l\u2019Ukraine. \u00ab Le d\u00e9clenchement de l\u2019attaque n\u2019a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 une surprise \u00bb, dit-il. \u00ab Le soir pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, des informations pr\u00e9cises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es par les alli\u00e9s \u00bb, selon lui. D\u00e8s que les premiers bombardements ont eu lieu dans la nuit du 23 au 24 f\u00e9vrier, \u00ab nous avons activ\u00e9 les mesures pr\u00e9vues, r\u00e9sume-t-il. Chaque poste qui devait \u00eatre renforc\u00e9 au sein des arm\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 renforc\u00e9 \u00bb.\n\n\nIl y a eu des divergences d\u2019analyses en mati\u00e8re de renseignement entre les Fran\u00e7ais et les pays anglo-saxons, reconna\u00eet le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard. \u00ab Les Am\u00e9ricains disaient que les Russes allaient attaquer, ils avaient raison. Nos services pensaient plut\u00f4t que la conqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ukraine aurait un co\u00fbt monstrueux et que les Russes avaient d\u2019autres options \u00bb pour faire chuter le r\u00e9gime de Volodymyr Zelensky, d\u00e9taille-t-il. Une forme de prudence vis-\u00e0-vis du renseignement am\u00e9ricain, h\u00e9rit\u00e9e notamment de la guerre en Irak de 2003.\n\n**Un nouveau centre de conduite des op\u00e9rations**\n\nCes d\u00e9bats pass\u00e9s, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but des combats, le 24 f\u00e9vrier, la France a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9ployer des moyens pour s\u2019int\u00e9grer dans les plans de l\u2019OTAN. D\u00e8s midi, une premi\u00e8re patrouille de Rafale a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e dans le ciel polonais, frontalier de l\u2019Ukraine. Depuis, la France continue d\u2019y assurer deux patrouilles de six \u00e0 huit heures par jour. Les Rafale d\u00e9collent de la base de Mont-de-Marsan (Landes), le ravitailleur, de celle d\u2019Istres (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne), ils volent jusqu\u2019en Pologne puis rentrent en France \u00e0 l\u2019issue de leur mission quotidienne. Des Awacs, ces avions de renseignement \u00e9quip\u00e9s de radars, partent, eux, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de la base d\u2019Avord, dans le Cher.\n\n\nToutes ces op\u00e9rations sont pilot\u00e9es depuis un b\u00e2timent flambant neuf, situ\u00e9 sur la base de Lyon-Mont Verdun (Rh\u00f4ne). Depuis l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2021, la France dispose d\u2019un nouveau centre air de planification et de conduite des op\u00e9rations (Capco) aux normes OTAN. Une vaste salle aux murs couverts d\u2019immenses \u00e9crans lui permettant de centraliser aussi bien les images de drones et les frappes contre les groupes arm\u00e9s terroristes au Sahel que les patrouilles aux limites de la fronti\u00e8re ukrainienne et les missions de transport a\u00e9rien pour les soldats fran\u00e7ais en train d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s en Roumanie. Soit une petite dizaine de vols par jour actuellement \u2013 le Capco peut en g\u00e9rer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 150 par jour.\n\nSur une carte de l\u2019Ukraine d\u00e9ploy\u00e9e dans son bureau, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard d\u00e9veloppe son analyse de la situation. M\u00eame s\u2019ils mettent plus de temps que pr\u00e9vu, \u00ab les Russes ont pour objectif de tron\u00e7onner l\u2019arm\u00e9e ukrainienne \u00bb, estime-t-il. Cette derni\u00e8re dispose d\u2019environ 40 000 hommes face au Donbass et de 50 000 autres pour tenir le reste du pays. \u00ab Mais pour isoler les premiers des deuxi\u00e8mes, les Russes vont devoir engager le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9chelon de leurs forces \u00bb, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait sans doute pas pr\u00e9vu, consid\u00e8re le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard. En plus des carences logistiques, l\u2019arm\u00e9e russe \u00ab semble avoir un sujet de combativit\u00e9 dans certaines unit\u00e9s \u00bb, qui n\u2019ont pas forc\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9es \u00e0 la haute intensit\u00e9, pense-t-il. Mais \u00ab le risque, c\u2019est que le rouleau compresseur \u00bb russe finisse par passer : une question de semaines ou de mois, li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019organisation de la r\u00e9sistance ukrainienne, \u00e9value-t-il.\n\n**Des mercenaires de Groupe Wagner en Ukraine**\n\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard, il n\u2019y a pas de certitudes \u00e0 ce stade sur la pr\u00e9sence de Bi\u00e9lorusses sur le th\u00e9\u00e2tre ukrainien. Il y en a plus en revanche du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des mercenaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e russe Groupe Wagner, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019aventure pas \u00e0 confirmer un chiffre. L\u2019engagement des Wagner en Ukraine peut d\u2019ailleurs avoir des cons\u00e9quences sur les capacit\u00e9s de d\u00e9ploiement des m\u00eames mercenaires au Mali, qui serait d\u00e9sormais autour de 1 000. La Russie a par ailleurs install\u00e9 une v\u00e9ritable \u00ab barri\u00e8re antia\u00e9rienne \u00bb, des Pays baltes \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, analyse le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard, notamment en d\u00e9ployant des syst\u00e8mes de d\u00e9fense S-400 tr\u00e8s sophistiqu\u00e9s.\n\nEn face, depuis le 24 f\u00e9vrier, l\u2019OTAN renforce ses capacit\u00e9s. Selon nos \u00e9valuations, environ 22 000 hommes sont d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s au sol, quelque 20 navires et 125 avions pour des patrouilles a\u00e9riennes ou de la police du ciel. Un vaste dispositif de la mer du Nord \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, au sein duquel les arm\u00e9es fran\u00e7aises, en plus de leur nouvelle mission en Pologne, vont maintenir 4 Mirage 2000 et 200 hommes en Estonie. A cet effort s\u2019ajoutent depuis le 28 f\u00e9vrier les 500 hommes envoy\u00e9s en renfort en Roumanie et, depuis ce samedi 5 mars, les moyens du porte-avions Charles-de-Gaulle \u00e0 partir de la mer Ionienne. D\u00e9rout\u00e9s de leur mission initiale, ces avions \u00ab pourront effectuer de la r\u00e9assurance avec des patrouilles a\u00e9riennes \u00bb, d\u00e9taille le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n\nSur la posture de dissuasion nucl\u00e9aire, qui rel\u00e8ve du domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, le chef d\u2019\u00e9tat-major des arm\u00e9es ne fait aucun commentaire. Le 1er mars, le journal Le T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que la France avait, pour la premi\u00e8re fois depuis 1981 et la crise des euromissiles, mis un deuxi\u00e8me sous-marin nucl\u00e9aire lanceur d\u2019engins (SNLE) en patrouille \u00e0 la mer. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, un seul des quatre SNLE bas\u00e9s \u00e0 L\u2019Ile-Longue (Finist\u00e8re) dont dispose la France assurait cette permanence. Un signal, alors que Moscou ne cesse d\u2019agiter la menace nucl\u00e9aire dans le conflit ukrainien et que ces sous-marins peuvent emporter 16 missiles (M51) chacun \u00e9quip\u00e9s de six t\u00eates nucl\u00e9aires.\n\n**Echange avec le chef d\u2019\u00e9tat-major russe**\n\nLe niveau de vigilance a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 renforc\u00e9 dans les domaines cyber et spatial, confirme le CEMA. Mais \u00ab aucun d\u00e9bordement intentionnel \u00bb du conflit ukrainien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 dans ces domaines-l\u00e0 pour l\u2019instant, assure le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard. A ce titre, il observe avec attention \u00ab la guerre du narratif \u00bb qui a actuellement lieu en Ukraine. \u00ab Les Ukrainiens se sont tr\u00e8s bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9silience cyber et de lutte informationnelle. Les Russes vont d\u00e9couvrir ce que c\u2019est que de remonter le narratif adverse face \u00e0 ce tsunami \u00bb, observe-t-il, tout en restant \u00e0 la fois prudent et circonspect sur les objectifs de Vladimir Poutine.\n\nLe 4 mars, pour la premi\u00e8re fois depuis plusieurs mois, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard a pu \u00e9changer au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec son homologue russe, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Val\u00e9ri Gu\u00e9rassimov. La discussion a port\u00e9 sur la situation au Sahel et en Europe de l\u2019Est, en particulier sur la guerre en Ukraine. Une d\u00e9marche dans les pas du Pentagone, qui a aussi annonc\u00e9, le 3 mars, avoir ouvert une \u00ab ligne de communication directe \u00bb avec l\u2019arm\u00e9e russe, \u00ab dans le but de pr\u00e9venir les malentendus, les incidents \u00e0 caract\u00e8re militaire et l\u2019escalade \u00bb.\n\nMalgr\u00e9 le d\u00e9clenchement de la guerre en Ukraine, le chef d\u2019\u00e9tat-major des arm\u00e9es doit continuer de veiller sur le Sahel, o\u00f9 la man\u0153uvre de retrait du Mali, annonc\u00e9e le 17 f\u00e9vrier par le chef de l\u2019Etat, est complexe. \u00ab Tout est mis en \u0153uvre pour tenir l\u2019objectif d\u2019un retrait en six mois, d\u00e9clare-t-il, c\u2019est un vrai d\u00e9fi. \u00bb \u00ab Il y aura un jour d\u2019apr\u00e8s \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer au Mali, comme il y aura un jour d\u2019apr\u00e8s pour la Russie et l\u2019Ukraine \u00bb, ajoute-t-il. A ce stade, les effectifs militaires fran\u00e7ais n\u2019ont pas encore baiss\u00e9 sur place. La bonne entente avec les forces arm\u00e9es maliennes (FAMA) est une des conditions de ce d\u00e9sengagement en bon ordre et en s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n\n\nPour r\u00e9ussir la r\u00e9articulation des capacit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises vers le golfe de Guin\u00e9e, ainsi que vers le Niger et le Burkina Faso, destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre deux pays pivots, \u00ab il faut que l\u2019on soit capable de modifier la mani\u00e8re dont on a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sents jusqu\u2019alors, insiste le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il y a un gros travail \u00e0 effectuer avec ces Etats pour savoir comment faire et les convaincre qu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019eux qui ont vraiment la r\u00e9ponse. Cela doit \u00eatre de la coconstruction \u00bb. Un autre chantier est celui de la \u00ab guerre des perceptions \u00bb, selon le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Burkhard. Des groupes de travail doivent aboutir \u00e0 de premi\u00e8res propositions d\u2019ici \u00ab deux ou trois mois \u00bb. \u00ab Il y a donc actuellement une n\u00e9cessaire et utile phase d\u2019incertitude \u00bb, conclut-il."}

Vous avez dit refus de l'essentialisme ? \n\nAujourd'hui, face \u00e0 un Vladimir Poutine qui a envahi un Etat souverain et fait poindre la menace nucl\u00e9aire, la principale inqui\u00e9tude de Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon semble \u00eatre le changement de doctrine de l'Allemagne en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9fense. \"L'Ukraine ne doit pas \u00eatre un pr\u00e9texte pour une nouvelle course aux armements. Et surtout pas en Allemagne\", a-t-il tweet\u00e9 le 26 f\u00e9vrier.

Quitte \u00e0 prendre la d\u00e9fense tous ses ennemis, de Hugo Chavez \u00e0 Vladimir Poutine, et qu'importent leurs propres agissements. Chez M\u00e9lenchon, la diabolisation sans nuance de l'Allemagne et des Etats-Unis contraste avec sa complaisance pour le r\u00e9gime autoritaire de Vladimir Poutine, qu'il se refuse \u00e0 qualifier de dictateur, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e9voquer un \"autocrate\" \u00e0 la \"mani\u00e8re de gouverner extr\u00eamement rugueuse\".  \n\"Ce pays qui a tant de mal \u00e0 en \u00eatre un\"...\n\nS'il pr\u00f4ne une sortie de l'Otan et un \"non-alignement\" , M\u00e9lenchon a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se rapprocher de Moscou. \"Si je gouvernais le pays [...], [il faudrait] construire une autre alliance et faire baisser la pression avec les Russes\", expliquait-il en 2019 sur la cha\u00eene Thinkerview, avant d'ajouter : \"Nous faisons semblant de croire que la Russie va envahir quelqu'un, or la Russie n'a naturellement l'intention d'envahir personne, et surtout pas les pays Baltes.\" Visionnaire...  \nLIRE AUSSI >> BHL : \"M\u00e9lenchon ou Zemmour se sentent plus proches de Poutine que de leur propre pays\"\n\n\"La rh\u00e9torique anti-imp\u00e9rialiste, qui est profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9e dans la culture politique d'une certaine gauche et d'une certaine droite, est un puissant vecteur d'adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 la Russie poutinienne, dont l'obsession est de se pr\u00e9senter comme un rempart conservateur face au n\u00e9olib\u00e9ralisme am\u00e9ricain\", notait d\u00e9j\u00e0 le chercheur Olivier Schmitt dans Pourquoi Poutine est notre alli\u00e9 ?, anatomie d'une passion fran\u00e7aise (Hikari Editions, 2016), pointant une \"longue tradition\" \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame gauche qui consiste \u00e0 \"pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le premier r\u00e9gime criminel venu aux Etats-Unis\".  \n\nChez M\u00e9lenchon, l'aveuglement id\u00e9ologique face au r\u00e9gime de Poutine se double d'une ma\u00eetrise quelque peu approximative de la politique russe. Sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux est ainsi ressortie la vid\u00e9o d'un passage en 2017 dans L'Emission politique sur France 2. Interrog\u00e9 par David Pujadas sur l'opposant Boris Nemtsov, assassin\u00e9 en 2015 \u00e0 quelques m\u00e8tres de Kremlin, M\u00e9lenchon s'emportait alors avec morgue : \"Le personnage dont vous me parlez, avec tant de mansu\u00e9tude, le connaissez-vous ? Savez-vous qui il est ? Savez-vous qu'il \u00e9tait un odieux antis\u00e9mite ?\" Stupeur du journaliste : \"Boris Nemtsov ?

Complotiste, il soup\u00e7onnait, sans aucune preuve, la main des Etats-Unis derri\u00e8re ce meurtre, afin d'aviver les tensions avec la Russie.  \n\nSelon Olivier Schmitt, l'anti-am\u00e9ricanisme primaire \"consiste \u00e0 penser que l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des actions au sein du syst\u00e8me international ne seraient que des r\u00e9actions par rapport \u00e0 ce que font les Am\u00e9ricains. Comme les Etats-Unis sont la plus grande puissance mondiale, les autres ne se positionneraient que par rapport \u00e0 eux. Quoiqu'il arrive, la cause premi\u00e8re serait toujours les Etats-Unis. C'est une vision tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ductrice, car cela enl\u00e8ve toute autonomie de d\u00e9cision propre aux acteurs locaux eux-m\u00eames. Dans le cas de la guerre en Ukraine, cela consiste \u00e0 dire que Poutine ne fait que se d\u00e9fendre, mais aussi que l'Ukraine ne serait qu'un champ de bataille entre les deux empires qui s'affrontent. Comme si les Ukrainiens eux-m\u00eames n'existaient pas. Dans cette vision, ils ne seraient que des marionnettes, sans volont\u00e9 propre.\" \n\nDans le m\u00eame texte sur son blog en 2015, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon ne masquait d'ailleurs pas son m\u00e9pris pour l'Ukraine, ses \"nazis\" et ses soutiens am\u00e9ricains, allant jusqu'\u00e0 souhaiter la disparition de ce pays fantoche : \"Tout repose donc \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent sur le sang froid de Vladimir Poutine et des dirigeants russes.

II s'agit d'une vision d\u00e9voy\u00e9e de sa position qui doit \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de non- align\u00e9e.

II n'en est rien, puisque Jean- Luc M\u00e9lenchon ne faisait alors que restituer la pens\u00e9e de Vladimir Poutine de l'\u00e9poque. \n\nPar ailleurs, l'article ne fait pas mention de l'attachement plusieurs fois affirm\u00e9 par Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon au principe d'inviolabilit\u00e9 des fronti\u00e8res dans le droit international, tel que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas en 2014, au moment de l'annexion de la Crim\u00e9e.

[America hasn't even sanctioned Russia's energy markets](https:\/\/www.bloombergquint.com\/business\/biden-spares-russia-s-crucial-energy-exports-from-sanctions). Perhaps Biden doesn't want a sanction induced cost of living crisis during the mid terms, who knows. \n\nAmerica has a big strategic interest in Taiwan, in that it is a battle ground between America's only peer competitor in an area of the world where American economic interests are far from guaranteed. Were America to let Taiwan fall, that'd be the end of pax Americana and America's presence in the pacific. Not true for Ukraine and American presence in Europe.\n\nIf Ukraine returns to the Russian sphere of influence (where it has been from the end of the cold war to 2014) then America and Europe lose nothing. US-EU trade will continue, Nato will remain strong in Poland and the Baltics, and if anything might be strengthened. \n\nAt the country level, Ukraine and Taiwan couldn't be more different. Taiwan is a functioning, advanced, law governed democracy with regular, legitimate elections. Ukraine is a basket case economy [run by oligarchs](https:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/blogs\/ukrainealert\/taming-ukraines-oligarchs\/), [which currently has the leader of the main opposition party under house arrest](https:\/\/www.euronews.com\/2021\/05\/13\/ukraine-opposition-leader-and-putin-ally-under-house-arrest-after-being-charged-with-treas) and [shuts down opposition media](https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/ukraine-zelenskiy-bans-three-opposition-tv-stations\/a-56438505). The arrests and the media shutdowns may or may not be justified, but they are hardly the examples of a free or democratic country. \n\nPutin's invasion of Ukraine is an undoubted crime, but doesn't fundamentally challenge any core American interest. Taiwan, I think (and hope, for the sake of East Asian liberty) does."}

Also, there was a picture of an Ukrainian using Type 95 Assault rifles, most likely from Pakistan. In fact, the Chinese have sold tanks to both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict and others that used soviet caliber.\n\nI would not be overly concerned about this.

{"country":"China","title":"A peek into China's propaganda and narrative on Ukraine and the wider world","sentiment":-0.4588,"text":"After paying close attention to Chinese social media and their reporting of the war in Ukraine, I am now very scared of the future. I just want to bring some awareness to some of the narratives being spread. \n\nI came across this popular video that is trending on the front page of Bilibili (China's equivalent to YouTube) and it perfectly sums up their narrative and talk points. The video not only regurgitates the Kremlin's narrative, but it also adds this very skewed and dangerous worldview where the West is on a crusade to subjugate and enslave the Chinese race and civilization. In that narrative, Russia is basically trying to break free of the Anglo Saxon + Jewish subjugation, and is trying to protect the Russian people and Russia against the West's corruption. The video propagates that democracy is a corrupting tool to weaken and damage Russian and Chinese civilizations and that people must not be swayed by the \"color revolutions\" and Western human rights activists. The video goes on to spread many fake news particularly regarding the international sanctions against Russia, and putting a racial spin on everything. That the West is using this war to demonize the whole Russian race, and the sanctions are put on all Russians even including the pro democracy Russian dissidents living in the West. That  the racism and oppression against Russians and Chinese are what Putin is fighting against. The talk points and disinformation goes on and on.\n\nI highly recommend people to visit the links listed below, just auto translate the entire page and read through the comments underneath the videos to get a deeper insight into this insular and scary parallel universe.\n\nthe video mentioned above: [https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV14b4y1s7gM](https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV14b4y1s7gM)\n\nThis popular video \"teaches\" Chinese people how to filter information regarding the war. Basically the narrative is that all Western media are fake news and are out to get you, so the Chinese firewall is there to protect you: [https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV12q4y147bL\/?spm\\_id\\_from=333.788.recommend\\_more\\_video.2](https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV12q4y147bL\/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.2)\n\nThis video shows how the Russian Chechen forces are rescuing trapped Ukrainian children. A very common and typical narrative on Chinese sites is that the Russians are in Ukraine to \"save\" the Ukrainian people from the evil regime of Zelensky: [https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV1ab4y1p7R4](https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV1ab4y1p7R4)\n\nThis video shows how the Chinese guest on BBC defended China and fought back against the Western media's evil attack. The comments on this video give a perfect representation of how China views Western media: [https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV15F411x7v8\/?spm\\_id\\_from=333.788.recommend\\_more\\_video.7](https:\/\/www.bilibili.com\/video\/BV15F411x7v8\/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.7)\n\nThere is also this sick sexual fascination and objectification of Ukrainian women that has been very common and popular on Chinese social media for many years. Some of the popular narratives on this was that \"Ukrainian women are beautiful but poor so now that we're rich lets go and buy them all\", or \"Ukrainian women now realize that Chinese men and China are superior to the West\". This phenomenon has started to be controlled and many videos were deleted due to the discovery and attention by some outside media, but you can still find this sick objectification and crazy jingoism common in comments of the videos when you search \"Ukrainian wife\" or \"Ukrainian beautiful women\". Interesting side note is that a lot of Ukrainian women (also just white women in general) who can speak Chinese also play into this willingly to appeal to the Chinese audience.\n\nUkrainian wife: [https:\/\/search.bilibili.com\/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AA%B3%E5%A6%87&from\\_source=webtop\\_search&spm\\_id\\_from=333.788](https:\/\/search.bilibili.com\/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E5%AA%B3%E5%A6%87&from_source=webtop_search&spm_id_from=333.788)\n\n\"Ukrainian beauties\": [https:\/\/search.bilibili.com\/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%B3&from\\_source=webtop\\_search&spm\\_id\\_from=333.788](https:\/\/search.bilibili.com\/all?keyword=%E4%B9%8C%E5%85%8B%E5%85%B0%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%B3&from_source=webtop_search&spm_id_from=333.788)\n\nAll the propaganda and fake news follows the same narrative, and all the trending videos and posts on popular social media sites reinforce that narrative. Meanwhile the Western media is oblivious and complacent to the stuff that CCP is spreading internally and externally (on YouTube in Chinese), which is the complete opposite to the innocence and neutrality act that Chinese diplomats plays on the international stage. Everyone is so afraid of being called a racist, but China doesn't have such worries. The CCP seems to be setting their people up for an ideological and civilizational confrontation with the West and with democracy. This war in Ukraine right now will look like a child's play when China is ready to flip the table and take on the rules based world order full on."}

Whether you agree with him or not, the real gist of Tucker Carlson\u2019s argument has been that getting bogged down in a war with Russia when Ukraine has no strategic relevance to the US is a distraction (of course he is wrong about that and he\u2019s too sympathetic towards Putin\u2019s victim blaming tactics), but his point has been that the real threat is China - I bet CCTV didn\u2019t mention that lol.\n\nA lot of people have been saying for a long time now that military attention needs to shift to China and away from Russia. This war massively helps China in as much as America was in the process of very publicly shifting its focus to China and away from Eastern Europe and now their focus is very publicly shifting back to Eastern Europe. I think what too many people are missing (both on the left and the right) is that this is a two headed beast and has been for some time now. The solution to this is that Europe starts pulling its own weight militarily. The UK for example now only has about 70,000 active soldiers in the army and they were due to make further cuts this year before all this kicked off. That\u2019s not enough troops to retake and hold one major city let alone a country. It\u2019s a joke. Europe needs to spend more on its own defence, be it collectively or at a state by state level. It has the wealth, man power and technological know how to put together a force that would collectively rival anyone but European politicians just don\u2019t want to spend money on defence."}

{"country":"China","title":"As Chinese. I have a lot of hesitation about people's attitude towards the war in Ukraine and my attitude towards CCP, can you explain it to me?","sentiment":-0.7964,"text":"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the biggest thing that happened in 2022. It was an invasion that violated international law. What's more important is that Russia has committed many war atrocities. At a time when progress in this war is still possible, I think it's highly understandable for many people to prefer an ending in which the bully is defeated. But I have a big worry, that is, I have also seen domestic support for Trump in the United States, and many sentiments that do not support continued assistance to Ukraine are also growing. Well, as a Chinese I think it's okay, just a foreign, and there is the one of the poorest places in Europe losing a small part of its own rule.\n\nBut what I am more worried about is: if Americans continue to consume their domestic enthusiasm for foreign things, what kind of help can China's democracy receive from the outside in further? You may not know that the CCP\u2019s internal suppression is very surprising. Before the trade war, the United States almost condoned various unfair international trade competition behaviors of the CCP, and even condoned commercial and technical espionage. This is very strange,but there is obviously a reason, because China has long been the largest trading partner of the United States. Chinese workers can tolerate very low wages but produce a lot. Ukraine is not the most important thing in my life, but the long-term peace disaster caused by the CCP, including their internal suppression, unemployment rate, and poverty, are very serious. From a righteous point of view, letting the worst dictatorship on earth collapse is also more important than the territory of Ukraine (I saw a lot of people on reddit saying I was hypocritical for thinking so, and then they blocked me), if If the CCP invades Taiwan, the entire world will be affected far more than the war in Ukraine. The CCP is also facing significant economic pressure now, because reforms forced by external forces are possible. This is not the first time for the United States.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be called a hypocrite on reddit just for saying a few words about human rights in my own country and my concerns about the domestic situation in the United States. This is very unreasonable.\n\nWhat do you think? r\/China? Do you care about China's politics? In this sub, do you only care about the Chinese girlfriends you see in life or \"China's trade competitiveness with the United States is declining?\" so you will be optimism ?If you are Americans, would you rather continue to support the fight against CCP after the war in Ukraine is over(with the possibly recession) , just like you support Ukraine?\n\nThis is an honest question that troubles my conscience"}

{"country":"China","title":"Economist: Joe Biden donates weapons to Taiwan, as he does to Ukraine","sentiment":0.5106,"text":"nonpaywall: merica has long believed that helping Ukraine to repel Russia\u2019s invasion was not only essential to preserving the security of Europe, but also important to deterring China from invading Taiwan. On July 28th it took that reasoning a leap forward by announcing it would for the first time start to arm Taiwan from America\u2019s own military stocks, as it has done repeatedly for Ukraine. The main difference is that it has not invoked an \u201cemergency\u201d to justify the move. Instead, it believes the arms supplies will help forestall a war across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe military move may instead provoke a new crisis. China will not accept American claims that it is nothing out of the ordinary, and represents \u201cno change\u201d in America\u2019s Taiwan policy. After all, America is shifting from selling weapons to Taiwan to subsidising its armed forces. Even before the announcement, a Chinese defence-ministry spokesman denounced arms supplies to Taiwan as \u201cmalicious acts\u201d, saying they posed \u201ca serious threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and created significant strategic risks in China-us military relations\u201d.\n\nThe question is whether, as in the past, China will show its anger by stepping up its military harassment of Taiwan, such as its daily testing of Taiwanese defences by flying close to its airspace and sailing near its territorial waters. Last year China fired salvos of missiles close to the self-governing island following a high-profile visit by Nancy Pelosi, the then Speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives. America has repeatedly accused China of carrying out dangerous manoeuvres close to its ships and planes, raising the risk of collision and superpower escalation.\n\nThe White House offered few details of the arms, worth $345m, to be supplied through the fast-track \u201cpresidential drawdown authority\u201d (pda). It said only that it would provide \u201cdefence articles and services\u201d as well as \u201cmilitary education and training\u201d. A Pentagon spokesman said the package would include unspecified anti-armour and anti-aircraft weapons, as well as \u201cmulti-domain awareness\u201d (mq-9A surveillance drones, according to leaks). More such military aid may soon follow, given that Lloyd Austin, the defence secretary, has said he intends to use the full $1bn authorised by Congress before the current fiscal year ends on September 30th.\n\nThe attempt to play down the move\u2014by burying the announcement in legalese and issuing it late on a Friday, classically a means of burying awkward news\u2014betrays a certain trepidation in the administration of President Joe Biden. He faces at least three sets of conflicting pressures.\n\nFirst is the worry about provoking a new crisis with China, having sent a succession of senior officials to talk to their Chinese counterparts since May. They include Jake Sulivan, the national security adviser; Antony Blinken, the secretary of state; Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary; and John Kerry, the climate envoy. All, in their various ways, have sought to create a \u201cfloor\u201d under Sino-American relations. But military-to-military communications are still all but non-existent. \u201cThe Department of Defence continues to seek open communication with Beijing,\u201d the Pentagon said, adding that it would \u201ccontinue to support Taiwan\u2019s maintenance of a sufficient self-defence capability.\u201d\n\nAgainst this effort is the countervailing pressure from Congress, especially Republicans, who accuse Mr Biden of being too soft on China and getting little in return for his diplomatic outreach. Indeed, some believe the president has delayed the Taiwan pda for fear of upsetting the Chinese\u2014a claim that American officials vehemently reject.\n\nThird, Mr Biden must satisfy Ukraine\u2019s pressing need for more weapons as its counter-offensive progresses slowly and its cities are repeatedly pounded by Russian missiles and drones. After a wave of attacks on Odessa, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, urged the world to create a \u201cfull-fledged sky shield\u201d over Ukraine. \u201cWe need more air-defence systems for our entire territory, for all our cities and communities. The world must not get used to Russian terror,\u201d he wrote in a Telegram post.\n\nThe Biden administration has hitherto claimed it could \u201cwalk and chew gum\u201d at the same time: that is, help push back Russia\u2019s onslaught while deterring China. Even as it has rallied European allies to help Ukraine defend itself, the administration has been weaving a variety of mini-alliances in the Indo-Pacific to constrain China. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin have been criss-crossing the Pacific this week to strengthen the geopolitical \u201clatticework\u201d. In Brisbane on July 29th they are expected to announce a further tightening of the military alliance with Australia, including the upgrading of military bases in the country, more deployments of American forces, deeper defence-industrial ties and greater military co-operation with other countries in the region.\n\nTypically military supplies for Ukraine have been donated from American stocks\u2014this week it announced its 43rd PDA for Ukraine, worth $400m and bringing the total to $24bn\u2014whereas Taiwan has bought its arms under the lengthier Foreign Military Sales system. The Pentagon says the Taiwan package will not affect supplies for Ukraine. Yet Ukraine and Taiwan are now competing for American donations and, in some cases, the same weapons, too. The backlog of Taiwanese orders, which stands at more than $14bn, includes contracts for the Javelin missile, used to stop tanks, and the Stinger, used to bring down aircraft. Large quantities of both have been supplied to Ukraine.\n\nIn contrast with the PDAs for Ukraine, Congress has not appropriated funds needed to replenish weapons being given to Taiwan. In the short term the Pentagon can probably re-allocate funds internally, say congressional staffers. But for the new Taiwan policy to be sustainable, Congress will have to appropriate money in the next fiscal year. That, in turn, will depend on the tortuous budgeting process in a divided Congress, especially the House, where \u201cAmerica First\u201d admirers of Donald Trump, who are sceptical if not hostile towards Ukraine, hold greater sway.\n\nAssuming Congress can agree on a budget on time, Mr Biden will probably face demands for even stronger measures to help Taiwan, including grants to buy weapons and more intense training. After all, one of the few issues on which Mr Biden\u2019s political supporters and foes can agree is the need to confront China. Some senior figures worry that such unanimity may prove an even greater danger than political dissension."}

Who knew that Ukraine is an independent, sovereign country (sarcasm)\u2014who they\u2019re close to, what organizations they join should be a right of sovereign independent countries.

Yeah, yeah, Orwellian terminology is overused, but I never saw such clear examples of doublethink in real life before I began following Chinese affairs. It was pretty shocking. So yes, I would describe China as a totalitarian country, and yes, I subsequently expect the government to hold a tight grip on its citizens' minds. For us Westerners, the absurdity and oppression is obvious, but we're on the outside looking in. Totalitarian control is more than just the blunt force of a boot stomping on a face forever; it's far more insidious than that. True control is putting the boot in the mind, stomping down dissident thought patterns--not because you're afraid to think dissident thoughts, but because it literally doesn't occur to you. If you grew up believing the stories your native media tells, why would you suddenly switch to believing foreign media when it claims that your native news is lying and your government is committing terrible deeds? That's just one example, but you get the idea. \n\nBeyond that, I think there's some psychological incentive to believe what the government says. Who wants to believe that their country is committing atrocities? Hell, look at how many people in the US get their panties in a twist when folks say, \"Hey, maybe we should talk about *past* shittiness in America.\" And even if you do believe, what can you do? You'll get censored for just posting sympathy for Hong Kong, and much worse if, God forbid, you actually take action. So why bother? Besides, do you *really* want to disturb the government that has provided so much stability and prosperity? Do you *really* want to go back to the age of warlords? It's so much easier to just nod and smile. But nodding and smiling on the surface is a slippery slope to nodding and smiling in the soul.\n\nSo the government has a tight grip on people's minds, so tight that many don't even realize it. In that situation, it takes a severe shock to shake people out of complacency. And that's what we're seeing right now. Better late than never, right? At least people are waking up and realizing that the pot is boiling, *has* been boiling for years.\n\nBut on the flipside...complacency is consent. And a lot of Chinese are *more* than just complacent. Maybe not the majority, but certainly enough to extend the reach of the CCP into other countries. Many of the little pinks who harass non-Chinese netizens are living outside of China. You regularly get stories of bullying on *foreign* campuses, where Chinese students who don't toe the party line get attacked by other Chinese students...and God help you if you're a Uyghur kid. You know, there are plenty of other authoritarian states with censored media, shitty schools, etc., where people are canny enough to see though the lies their government tells. There are plenty of immigrants and students from dictatorial countries who are willing to listen to alternative views, even if they don't always agree with them. Why are Chinese citizens so different? In that context, this new awareness seems profoundly selfish, and I have to wonder how long it will last.\n\nSo I'm ambivalent. I understand how insidious state-sponsored brainwashing can be, and I'm glad to see people shaking it off. But I can't help but wonder how genuine this sentiment is. It depends on what happens in the future--will people hold onto this perspective after the quarantine lifts? Or will the horrors of Shanghai become another bizarre aberration to be memory-holed with a million other misdeeds?"}

Yes, China built large dams, but also Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. \n\nFurthermore, the idea that dams lead to droughts is false. Large dams might cause some reduction when they are filling up, but in the long run, they contribute to regulating water flows and mitigating the hazards of droughts and flooding (as they are designed to do). The largest impacts that dams have is on sediments and aquatic ecosystems, not water quantity. \n\nChina definitely needs to be transparent and cooperative in managing the Mekong River, though.\n\nPS: There have been multiple reports about the impacts of dams on Mekong river. Most have mentioned the undeniable effects of dams on silt and sediments, as well as on livelihoods of farming and fishery communities downstream. However, still little evidence is supporting the notion on the impacts of dams on water discharge. There are some reports from Eyes on Earth indicating that, but there are also counterargument. You can read this report from MRC about the 2018-2019 droughts (which also cites other reports from Eyes on Earth and Tsinghua Uni.)\nhttps:\/\/www.mrcmekong.org\/assets\/Publications\/Mekong-low-flow-and-drought-conditions-2019-2021df.pdf"}

A lot of these political tools emphasize who is more \"yellow\" and who is not. These are just subtle racist dog whistles."}
